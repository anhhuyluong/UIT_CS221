When i tried to return them, the shipping wasn't paid for. So i had to pay $20 for shipping. A waste of time and money. I dont recommend anyone to buy from TheSmartBuy.  \n",

These allow my heel to rise out the back even tightly laced, and so just won't work for any kind of strenuous movement (again, for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the NB 623 ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JTXJX0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 ) which DO have a rise at the back and fit me much better.

They breathe really well, and my feet don't get overly warm in them.  Update:  After owning these shoes for a bit over a year, and wearing them approximately 150 days out of that year (generous estimate) they began falling apart. 99% of the shoe is fine, and has little wear, but the upper is separating from the sole, exposing my toes / socks.  When I approached Altra's customer service about my concerns, they were very dismissive and seemingly unwilling to listen to my feedback as a customer. They told me I should take the issue up with Amazon, since I purchased them here. I don't think Amazon has anything to do with the quality of the product.  They made zero attempts to satisfy me as a customer, so it is with regret that I must look for comfortable wide toe-box shoes from other companies.  This is not an uncommon issue for these shoes, and other models that Altra offers. If you are also interested in zero drop wide toe shoes, I've discovered SKORA, VIVO and Topo in my quest to find alternatives. It's a shame, because while these shoes hold together, they are simply fantastic, but they fall apart too quickly.  https://skorarunning.com/  http://www.vivobarefoot.com/us  http://topoathletic.com/</td>\n",

So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big surprise - at least to me - these shoes are UGLY!  I'm a software guy (as you may have already surmised), so what do I care.  I asked people at work (people 30 years younger than I) thinking that perhaps these weren't ugly, but just in fashion (another subject about which I know nothing).  But no, the unanimous opinion is that these shoes are UGLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to wear them every day until they fall apart (or fail to protect me in the coming rainy season) - but I didn't want anyone to say that they weren't warned.</td>\n",

The problem? The color was NOTHING like the picture. I ordered the brown, which as you can see is the color of milk chocolate-- a nice rich, medium shade of brown. Maybe a hint of red. Just a shade or so darker than the boots on the left. What I GOT was more like dark chocolate-- as in, almost black. I briefly wondered if my mom had ordered the wrong color, but the color I received isn't shown in any of these pictures. It most closely resembles the &amp;#34;Brown PU&amp;#34; shade from this model: http://www.amazon.com/West-Blvd-Phoenix-Slouch-Slouchy/dp/B00NR7VQRO/ref=pd_sim_309_6?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0288V3ZCR0TBYF8X3KJK. In fact, the box says that the shoe is &amp;#34;Brown PU&amp;#34; when we ordered simply &amp;#34;Brown&amp;#34;. The exact same color on the other model is called Tan PU, but since the tan on this model actually looks tan, I'm not sure ordering the tan would solve my problem either. It looks like they simply only have this darker color of brown and posted the wrong picture for it... which is an issue, because I got these boots to match another item of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: The transition between the heel and the ankle is incredibly awkward. It feels like there is a shoe inside the boot, and the &amp;#34;leg&amp;#34; portion of the boot is merely a loose leather sock coming up from it. Because of the structureless &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; feeling, the leg portion easily slips down and wrinkles at the ankle. Yes, all boots have more structure in the feet-- but the difference in these boots is much more obvious. They probably need some thick socks/boot cuffs to hold them up.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, unless you haven't read other reviews, it's not actually thigh-high. The top of the &amp;#34;flap&amp;#34; portion just barely passes over the knee... still, they're taller than most boots and look great with the flap turned down. Unfortunately the flap covers the first &amp;#34;belt&amp;#34; decoration, but you can see the second one.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was really hoping for a thin foot on the boot, since the &amp;#34;squashed beanbag&amp;#34; look from my hiking boots was what caused me to purchase these. I hate it when my feet look wide from the top. These are a huge improvement, but still a little squashed on the inner curve of my foot. Maybe I got have really thin feet... if you have wide feet, this will probably be perfect if not a little snug. But for me, I was hoping for a little more structure.th the flap turned down.

I wear an 8 or 8 1/2 depending on the shoe and I wore an 8 in the plastic buckle shoes. The plastic buckle shoes also have a different sole. (see pictures below)  I like these the best even though the buckle on one broke immediately. It was an easy fix. The metal piece in the buckle came off. I snapped it back on and used needle nose pliers to crimp it so it does not come off again. Then I did this to all of the ones with a plastic buckles even before I wore them just to make sure it does not happen again. After wearing these a couple times, I no longer need to unbuckle them. I can just slip them on and go. These are by far my favorite.  Any spot that rubs my foot at all, I put a spot on. I do this with all my shoes and never have issues. Spots work miracles! The ones with the metal buckle fit differently. They seem to run a little small and for some reason were very uncomfortable for me in the toe area even in an 8 //2. I returned them after buying several pair and nothing felt good on my foot. I think the metal buckle ones are better quality. Look at the toe area between the two types. The metal buckles have smaller and less toe room. They are also a more flat platform.   In summary, the plastic buckle runs slightly big and has a different angle that looks fantastic and makes your legs look like you are wearing heels even though they are completely comfy. The metal buckle runs small, has a different sole and is more of a flat platform.

I wore them every day this summer, and they do get stinky  but after a little research I found an easy solution (http://frugalfun4boys.com/2013/06/12/the-stinky-sandal-solution/) basically:&lt;br /&gt;1. Rinse shoes (I used a hose, but they are machine washable). 2. Sprinkle with baking soda. 3. Spray with 50/50 vinegar/water solution. 4. Let them sit. 5. Rinse with water. 6. Let them dry in the sun&lt;br /&gt;I did that every few weeks or when I started to notice the stench, and it worked perfectly.</td>\n",

Within 3 weeks, while wearing the glasses, one lens fell out, hit the ground and shattered.  I thought, no biggie, I'll send them to Ray Ban for repairs, which I have done several times for my now 12 year old Maui Jims.  I received a letter back from Ray Ban stating they could not be repaired because they aren't authentic Ray Bans. I am crushed. Of course they are not replaceable with the seller, Sunglass Mall. I am so very disappointed. I will never order from them again. So, I suppose I am out $117 and the cost to send the damaged glasses with insurance to Ray Ban. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030CGF86/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear  Dr. Martens,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt compelled to write your company and tell you how extremely disappointed I am with the quality of your boots. I am 39 years old and when I was a kid your company was highly respected for making quality boots that lasted forever. Sadly your company has turned into a mockery of your once respected name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult I am required to wear steel-toe shoes due to insurance reasons where I work. However, I do not do any form of hard labor. I am an avionics technician.  Several years ago, when my company mandated that the workers start wearing steel-toe shoes, we all sighed. However, my first thought was Dr. Martens. I immediately bought a pair of Dr. Martens 1919 which was perfect because although they were not truly safety rated boots they would pass our inspection for steel toe shoes and were not as bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore those boots for about 3 and half years. I would have continued to wear them if it was not for the two holes that wore into each side of the one boot. Although I expected them to last longer I was not that upset since I almost got 4 years out of them. During my time of wearing them many of my co-workers thought the boots looked great and were impressed that they lasted so long and several of them bought Dr. Martens based on my experience. Mind you, there are 3000 employees that work at my company and we all hate steel-toe shoes and hate that we are being forced to wear them. Especially since the work we do does not risk our feet. So we are all always looking for better quality or lighter shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my experience, I decided to buy a pair of 8761's, they looked like they would last much longer and they cost even more money $140.00. I was excited to get them and as I did with my first pair I would regularly tell people at work that they would get more out of their money with Dr. Martens boots then they would get from other brands. Well all of my talk came to an end rather quickly with the 8761's. Within 6 months the damn soles started coming apart. People at work that were wearing generic Wal-Mart shoes were getting longer lasting foot wear then my expensive Dr. Martens. I felt like a fool and felt like I had been robbed. The company I work for gives their employees $65.00 a year toward shoes. I had wasted 2 years worth of money on a pair of boots that did not even last 6 months. You should see the boots now they look like they are 15 years old yet they are maybe a year and a half old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is time for me to buy another pair of shoes. A lot of the guys at work have been having some good luck with steel toe shoes from Keen. I think I will give them a try. I don't feel like throwing my money down the toilet. I will leave that for un-informed pop punk teenagers that want to look cool, not the working class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your company feels that you owe me as I do, you are welcome to make a shoe donation to me and I am willing to give you another try but not on my dime. I wear a size 41 and you can contact me at propagnesiaaa@hotmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Otherwise My days of promoting Dr. Martens is over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to share some pictures of the boots with you. Either go to these tiny pic links or email me and i will send you some pictures of how bad these boots are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are pictures of the newest pair, with the soles split on both boots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/20fw8kh/8&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/2wmjrkw/8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are pictures of the old pair with holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/xq9jkh/8&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/25a1zs9/8Within 6 months the damn soles started coming apart.

What they don't show is on inside of the glasses the words &#34;PUNCH GP3&#34; are on one arm and &#34;www.grinderpunch.com&#34; is on the other. It's very distracting and looks very unprofessional. I definitely would not have purchased these if I knew that beforehand.\n",

the only one that Amazon shows in its page [ http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BIR13A?ref_=pe_1196280_123950170 ], you see the shoes all in the same tones and colors: brown-ish.<br /><br />But when I receive the product I was in shock with the rubber that cover the tip and the sides of the shoes, it is GREY! You can't see that on the image. It was unpleasant. The shoes are fine, they are comfortable, but the colors aren't.\n",

                                                          I am returning the Bag  because it is simply too large.  Other than that it<br />is a pretty bag.https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nKKjW1mhL._SS300_.jpg\n",

These allow my heel to rise out the back even tightly laced, and so just won't work for any kind of strenuous movement (again, for me).<br /><br />I ended up buying the NB 623 ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JTXJX0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) which DO have a rise at the back and fit me much better.  They also are cheaper, a nice bonus.<br /><br />Everyone's foot is different, and everyone's shoe's needs are, so these might work for you (and Amazon's return policy allows you to try them out).  But overall I'd just pass on these and get the 623.\n",

use they are very beat up.  I had purchased her a pair of black dance shoes http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041IXFSQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 and she immediately commented that they are a better shoe.\n",

Worst part was that I didn't use it everyday. I wear this maybe twice a week at most. I would usually wear a Kenneth Cole Boating Shoe (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C9QC3MQ?colid=Q24VI7B5IUHV&coliid=IPFRNQS5JW9RW&psc=1&ref_=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl), most of the time. The Kenneth Cole shoe has been able to sustain the wear I put on to it for a longer period of time.\n",

I wear them out on my ranch doing casual chores...  seams never separate...  soles never come off...  never come apart before I have literally worn them out.<br /><br />I use foam/gel insoles to make them feel comfy till they are done.

See attached: http://images.tripleblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/IMG_0602.jpg Those were my first pairs of Hi-Tecs and they were stupid awesome. Still have them, still love them in their worn-out state, but Hi-Tec doesn't make the IVs that way anymore and now I'm suspicious. So I've taken a leap of faith and purchased Vs.<br /><br />I'm slowly breaking them in, haven't left pavement yet. Worn them for most of the day walking back and forth to school. The heel is designed so that you really do kind of roll in your step where as my old IVs were more Clop Clop. They do sweat my feet, but then I generally put foot powder in any non-breathing shoe if it's over 70-75 degrees in the area.<br /><br />This review is subject to change, but so far I like 'em. And if you're the kind of show-off hiker poser who tucks his pants behind the tongues so they're sticking out (like me), you should know they don't lay as flat and upright as my old IVs did.\n",

I don't know if the soles differ by style or if they have changed over the years (my older sandals are about 2 years old), but the soles on my other FitFlops are 0.5&#34; wider than these.  I wear an 8.5 and bought a 9.  My feet cover the entire width of the soles of these shoes, but my toe tips are about 2 inches from the front of them, so my feet look like spatulas standing on skis.  Luckily, I bought them to wear around the house, because they look really stupid due to the fit.  Granted, I have short wide feet, but the great fit of my old pair is what drove me to buy these.  For reference, this is my old pair: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005LBYOSW/ref=twister_B008DTGDBU\n",

skecher's men's superior gains slip on for my son.  he's 15 and likes really comfy slip on shoes.  he's had several of the skechers fabric slip ons and likes them.  i thought this shoe, described as leather and pictured as having a luxurious leather grain, would be his dressy upgrade.  what we received is a comfortable, well fitting shoe, but it is not leather.  it's a plastic shoe.  i think it may be the men's gains slip on, not superior but the inferior version.  didn't realize the discrepancy until after he'd worn them too much to return.  if you order these, be careful to check that you receive the correct version of two very similar shoe styles with very similar names.  see the impostor at this link

The defect has caused noticeable buckling which is unsatisfactory to me. I had to return them. Also, the inner sole seemed to be popping out of the shoe upon opening the box - which seemed like a bad sign. I had owned a pair of these for 3 years and they began to look too dirty to wear but I would still use them for work shoes because they were so comfortable. Sadly, I feel like New Balance's QC standards have lowered since the last time I purchased these exact shoes. ::sigh::  I'm disappointed because the material is very classy looking (to me) and I liked having a super comfy pair of sneaks that were once frequently complimented by strangers. Alas, the experience was meant not to be duplicated. I will be most likely moving on from the 442 line which I had been loyal to for roughly 5 years.<br /><br />Sidebar: I also purchased http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H2YJJ4U?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_16 at around the same time from a different vendor with the inner sole popping out - but no puckering sewing defects.\n",

I will be returning them.  Any piece of clothing that is Goretex will be marked as such on the item.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Adidas-Terrex-Swift-GTX-Shoe/dp/B00AZNSK68/ref=cm_wl_huc_item<br /><br />This model is Goretex.<br /><br />They seem like good shoes just not as described.\n",

Is there a way that we can change these for another type of Reebok? In this case where product is not acceptable, can you refund the cost so that we can purchase anther type that seem what we were really looking for?

I usually hate shoes. The wide toe box and zero drop are great features. They're exceptionally light (in weight) and comfortable for all day wear. They breathe really well, and my feet don't get overly warm in them.  Update:  After owning these shoes for a bit over a year, and wearing them approximately 150 days out of that year (generous estimate) they began falling apart. 99% of the shoe is fine, and has little wear, but the upper is separating from the sole, exposing my toes / socks.  When I approached Altra's customer service about my concerns, they were very dismissive and seemingly unwilling to listen to my feedback as a customer. They told me I should take the issue up with Amazon, since I purchased them here. I don't think Amazon has anything to do with the quality of the product.  They made zero attempts to satisfy me as a customer, so it is with regret that I must look for comfortable wide toe-box shoes from other companies.  This is not an uncommon issue for these shoes, and other models that Altra offers. If you are also interested in zero drop wide toe shoes, I've discovered SKORA, VIVO and Topo in my quest to find alternatives. It's a shame, because while these shoes hold together, they are simply fantastic, but they fall apart too quickly.  https://skorarunning.com/  http://www.vivobarefoot.com/us  http://topoathletic.com/\n",

These do not keep the back of my foot anchored in well - so if I run for a couple miles; I get blisters on the back of my ankles.  I never had that problem with the Speed Cross 3 shoes ( http://amzn.to/1SAZAbW ) that I had been buying before.\n",

These are SO uncomfortable.  I can't believe they call the soles &#34;padded.&#34;  It's like walking barefoot on concrete.  The soles feel like a hard plastic rather than rubber.  There is zero cushion.  The material looks cheap and doesn't breath.  If you want the wide size, they seem to be charging twice the price for the same boot.  When I bought these shoes for $100, they were simultaneously selling the regular, non wide, version for under $50. (see link below).  For $100, I just don't get why these aren't made better.  It seems like if any there were a shoe you could hide padding in, a boot would be the easiest. On top of that, there's a $8.00 return fee that is not mentioned on the page.  Never ordering from a company that makes you pay returns on something so expensive to begin with.  Do not recommend.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Comfortview-Womens-Darcy-Bootie-Black/dp/B005GPYHFI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436489236&sr=8-1&keywords=darcy+bootie\n",

The gold straps are not metal.<br />2. Based on the other reviews, I bought one size up but turns out to be too large.<br />3. Very strong stench that you cannot air out<br />4. Very poor quality. The zipper is not smooth and some will not budge. The leathers have no support, becomes very wrinklely when you wear it.<br />5. The origin is from United Kingdom so the return shipment that YOU have to pay exceeds the product value.<br />6. The only good thing that I can say is that the shipping was very fast.<br />WILL NEVER RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.\n",

I've bought two pairs of the linked SL 72s and they both lean a bit to the inside.<br /><br />The item being sold here does not lean to the inside, which I prefer.<br /><br />A big downside of these shoes is that Adidas will certainly either discontinue them quickly, or at least Adidas will again keep the name and redo the sneaker making unwary buyers buy something different from last purchase (kind of like ROM sneaker from 2005 which became more like SAMBA sneaker a few years back).  It's already confusing that there are two sneakers with different fits that are both named SL 72. But even worse is when Adidas will cancel and not say what new sneaker fits like this one. Great manufacturing, great quality, good prices, awful marketing.\n",

First the background - my feet get cold, so I need insulated shoes and I am not a big fan of getting my feet wet, so waterproof is also a requirement.  Until now, I had been wearing Salomon Men's Eskape Mid GTX Hiking Boot (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JFC1LE?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage), but they were starting to tear after two years of daily use.  And I wanted something that goes on/off faster.  So I got the Keens.<br /><br />On the positive side, they keep my feet warm as advertized.  Hasn't rained yet, but they seem waterproof, so that is fine too.  The sizing is a bit big, so my heels slide out a little, esp. if I walk fast, but that is somewhat expected in a slip on.  So far, so good.<br /><br />The big surprise - at least to me - these shoes are UGLY!  I'm a software guy (as you may have already surmised), so what do I care.  I asked people at work (people 30 years younger than I) thinking that perhaps these weren't ugly, but just in fashion (another subject about which I know nothing).  But no, the unanimous opinion is that these shoes are UGLY.<br /><br />I am going to wear them every day until they fall apart (or fail to protect me in the coming rainy season) - but I didn't want anyone to say that they weren't warned.\n",

Bought these about a month ago, and they still hurt my feet. To add insult to injury, the eyelets for the laces are rough (the laces do not slide through them smoothly) and have worn thru and broken one of the laces; the other is showing considerable wear. Not happy at all with these.<br /><br />I have applied for a refund, and I am awaiting the vendor's review/decision. Will return if I can. Will gift to a friend if I can't. Maybe they will have better luck! For me, I will by buying another pair of these (Love them!!!): http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RUF41S\n",

I have purchased 3 different shoes since last year for my 5 yr old Son.<br />My first purchase was http://www.amazon.com/Stride-Rite-Griffin-Sneaker-Toddler/dp/B00APVAGXU/ref=sr_1_112?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1440347380&sr=1-112&nodeID=3420717011&refinements=p_89%3AStride+Rite which were really good shoes. My son used them for about 7 months until they worn out due to regular use and  he really liked these shoes and found them very comfortable.<br /><br />Then based on my experience with this shoe I did second purchase - http://www.amazon.com/Stride-Rite-SRT-Jasper-Rubber/dp/B00I4XACXK/ref=sr_1_49?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1440347364&sr=1-49&nodeID=3420717011&refinements=p_lbr_brands_browse-bin%3AStride+Rite, which lasted 4-5 months. I did observe that these ones worn out earlier than the previous one.<br /><br />But, I still liked their design and how comfortable my son felt by wearing them. Hence, I gave it another try and ordered this 3rd pair of StrideRite. They are good fit and comfortable as earlier products. But, in mere 2 months and comparatively lesser daily use (due to summer vacations) the stitches near front area above toe came out and I can clearly see that it would be unusable in next few days.<br /><br />It looks like the material and build quality of Stride Rite shoes is getting worse.<br /><br />StrideRite, I really liked your shoes, my son enjoyed wearing them as his regular school pair but I am not going to order next one from you. Please improve the quality and use durable material for your products.\n",

However this model has a design flaw: It was too loose on the top even though I have high arches. So it would create blisters and/or not nearly enough support for walking. I tried them on and immediately took them off to return. However, the seller, Shoe&co (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/details/ref=aag_m_ss?ie=UTF8&asin=&isAmazonFulfilled=0&isCBA=&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&orderID=112-7566541-3136260&seller=A28XBRTMF2PS9Z#aag_legalInfo) charges a hefty restocking fee (15%) and the shipping fee of at least $10 also would be deducted from any refund they offer.

Have been wearing Fit Flops for over 5 years now, and wouldn't change them for any other type or similar imitations.  Have them in different colors and style.  They are comfy, and stylish.  Love them!https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D2ZF686/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0\n",

The problem? The color was NOTHING like the picture. I ordered the brown, which as you can see is the color of milk chocolate-- a nice rich, medium shade of brown. Maybe a hint of red. Just a shade or so darker than the boots on the left. What I GOT was more like dark chocolate-- as in, almost black. I briefly wondered if my mom had ordered the wrong color, but the color I received isn't shown in any of these pictures. It most closely resembles the &#34;Brown PU&#34; shade from this model: http://www.amazon.com/West-Blvd-Phoenix-Slouch-Slouchy/dp/B00NR7VQRO/ref=pd_sim_309_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=0288V3ZCR0TBYF8X3KJK. In fact, the box says that the shoe is &#34;Brown PU&#34; when we ordered simply &#34;Brown&#34;. The exact same color on the other model is called Tan PU, but since the tan on this model actually looks tan, I'm not sure ordering the tan would solve my problem either. It looks like they simply only have this darker color of brown and posted the wrong picture for it... which is an issue, because I got these boots to match another item of mine.<br /><br />Other notes: The transition between the heel and the ankle is incredibly awkward. It feels like there is a shoe inside the boot, and the &#34;leg&#34; portion of the boot is merely a loose leather sock coming up from it. Because of the structureless &#34;sock&#34; feeling, the leg portion easily slips down and wrinkles at the ankle. Yes, all boots have more structure in the feet-- but the difference in these boots is much more obvious. They probably need some thick socks/boot cuffs to hold them up.<br />Obviously, unless you haven't read other reviews, it's not actually thigh-high. The top of the &#34;flap&#34; portion just barely passes over the knee... still, they're taller than most boots and look great with the flap turned down. Unfortunately the flap covers the first &#34;belt&#34; decoration, but you can see the second one.<br />Finally, I was really hoping for a thin foot on the boot, since the &#34;squashed beanbag&#34; look from my hiking boots was what caused me to purchase these. I hate it when my feet look wide from the top. These are a huge improvement, but still a little squashed on the inner curve of my foot. Maybe I got have really thin feet... if you have wide feet, this will probably be perfect if not a little snug. But for me, I was hoping for a little more structure.th the flap turned down.

The ones with the white plastic buckle tend to run true to size or even a little big. I wear an 8 or 8 1/2 depending on the shoe and I wore an 8 in the plastic buckle shoes. The plastic buckle shoes also have a different sole. (see pictures below)  I like these the best even though the buckle on one broke immediately. It was an easy fix. The metal piece in the buckle came off. I snapped it back on and used needle nose pliers to crimp it so it does not come off again. Then I did this to all of the ones with a plastic buckles even before I wore them just to make sure it does not happen again. After wearing these a couple times, I no longer need to unbuckle them. I can just slip them on and go. These are by far my favorite.  Any spot that rubs my foot at all, I put a spot on. I do this with all my shoes and never have issues. Spots work miracles! The ones with the metal buckle fit differently. They seem to run a little small and for some reason were very uncomfortable for me in the toe area even in an 8 //2. I returned them after buying several pair and nothing felt good on my foot. I think the metal buckle ones are better quality. Look at the toe area between the two types. The metal buckles have smaller and less toe room. They are also a more flat platform.   In summary, the plastic buckle runs slightly big and has a different angle that looks fantastic and makes your legs look like you are wearing heels even though they are completely comfy. The metal buckle runs small, has a different sole and is more of a flat platform.  ALSO NOTE YOU PAY FOR RETURN SHIPPING IF THEY DON&#34;T FIT IF YOU BUY FROM SHOE CENTER - So basically there is no return because it cost more to ship it back than the shoe is worth.   Here are the spots which you can buy just about anywhere.

These were perfect and comfortable the entire time. I wore them every day this summer, and they do get stinky  but after a little research I found an easy solution (http://frugalfun4boys.com/2013/06/12/the-stinky-sandal-solution/) basically:<br />1. Rinse shoes (I used a hose, but they are machine washable). 2. Sprinkle with baking soda. 3. Spray with 50/50 vinegar/water solution. 4. Let them sit. 5. Rinse with water. 6. Let them dry in the sun<br />I did that every few weeks or when I started to notice the stench, and it worked perfectly.\n",

Found the best price for authentic Ray Ban Aviators.  The exact pair I wanted.  Within 3 weeks, while wearing the glasses, one lens fell out, hit the ground and shattered.  I thought, no biggie, I'll send them to Ray Ban for repairs, which I have done several times for my now 12 year old Maui Jims.  I received a letter back from Ray Ban stating they could not be repaired because they aren't authentic Ray Bans. I am crushed. Of course they are not replaceable with the seller, Sunglass Mall. I am so very disappointed. I will never order from them again. So, I suppose I am out $117 and the cost to send the damaged glasses with insurance to Ray Ban. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030CGF86/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0\n",
       "83394  Dear  Dr. Martens,<br /><br />I felt compelled to write your company and tell you how extremely disappointed I am with the quality of your boots. I am 39 years old and when I was a kid your company was highly respected for making quality boots that lasted forever. Sadly your company has turned into a mockery of your once respected name.<br /><br />As an adult I am required to wear steel-toe shoes due to insurance reasons where I work. However, I do not do any form of hard labor. I am an avionics technician.  Several years ago, when my company mandated that the workers start wearing steel-toe shoes, we all sighed. However, my first thought was Dr. Martens. I immediately bought a pair of Dr. Martens 1919 which was perfect because although they were not truly safety rated boots they would pass our inspection for steel toe shoes and were not as bulky.<br /><br />I wore those boots for about 3 and half years. I would have continued to wear them if it was not for the two holes that wore into each side of the one boot. Although I expected them to last longer I was not that upset since I almost got 4 years out of them. During my time of wearing them many of my co-workers thought the boots looked great and were impressed that they lasted so long and several of them bought Dr. Martens based on my experience. Mind you, there are 3000 employees that work at my company and we all hate steel-toe shoes and hate that we are being forced to wear them. Especially since the work we do does not risk our feet. So we are all always looking for better quality or lighter shoes.<br /><br />After my experience, I decided to buy a pair of 8761's, they looked like they would last much longer and they cost even more money $140.00. I was excited to get them and as I did with my first pair I would regularly tell people at work that they would get more out of their money with Dr. Martens boots then they would get from other brands. Well all of my talk came to an end rather quickly with the 8761's. Within 6 months the damn soles started coming apart. People at work that were wearing generic Wal-Mart shoes were getting longer lasting foot wear then my expensive Dr. Martens. I felt like a fool and felt like I had been robbed. The company I work for gives their employees $65.00 a year toward shoes. I had wasted 2 years worth of money on a pair of boots that did not even last 6 months. You should see the boots now they look like they are 15 years old yet they are maybe a year and a half old.<br /><br />Anyway, it is time for me to buy another pair of shoes. A lot of the guys at work have been having some good luck with steel toe shoes from Keen. I think I will give them a try. I don't feel like throwing my money down the toilet. I will leave that for un-informed pop punk teenagers that want to look cool, not the working class.<br /><br />If your company feels that you owe me as I do, you are welcome to make a shoe donation to me and I am willing to give you another try but not on my dime. I wear a size 41 and you can contact me at propagnesiaaa@hotmail.com<br /><br /> Otherwise My days of promoting Dr. Martens is over...<br /><br />I will be happy to share some pictures of the boots with you. Either go to these tiny pic links or email me and i will send you some pictures of how bad these boots are.<br /><br />here are pictures of the newest pair, with the soles split on both boots.<br /><br />http://tinypic.com/r/20fw8kh/8<br />http://tinypic.com/r/2wmjrkw/8<br /><br />here are pictures of the old pair with holes.<br /><br />http://tinypic.com/r/xq9jkh/8<br />http://tinypic.com/r/25a1zs9/8Within 6 months the damn soles started coming apart.

I wear a size 41 and you can contact me at propagnesiaaa@hotmail.com<br /><br /> Otherwise My days of promoting Dr. Martens is over...<br /><br />I will be happy to share some pictures of the boots with you. Either go to these tiny pic links or email me and i will send you some pictures of how bad these boots are.<br /><br />here are pictures of the newest pair, with the soles split on both boots.<br /><br />http://tinypic.com/r/20fw8kh/8<br />http://tinypic.com/r/2wmjrkw/8<br /><br />here are pictures of the old pair with holes.<br /><br />http://tinypic.com/r/xq9jkh/8<br />http://tinypic.com/r/25a1zs9/8"

What I liked the Best about them is that they are mostly &amp;#34;mesh&amp;#34; on top which makes for a lightweight shoe.&lt;br /&gt;DONOT PURCHASE THEM because after you wear them for approx. 3-4 weeks the mesh rips on Both shoes in two places. A rip/hole will appear on shoe where your big toe begins and on the same place (next to little toe) on other side of shoe😞. I hoped maybe I had simply received a &amp;#34;defective&amp;#34; pair if shoes, so I called Amazon and they promptly sent me a new pair of the exact same shoe.(Just as I requested!) Wore them for a couple weeks, love them so much that when i saw they had the exact Ascic shoe with a &amp;#34;melon color&amp;#34; (the first ones i ordered were black, silver&amp;pink) i HAD to have them too!!(our scrubs@work are black and MELON color) Got the 2nd pair of shoes and switched back and forth, wearing the black/pink pair one day..and wearing the melon colored ones the next day!&lt;br /&gt;Was SO VERY DISAPPOINTED when the first hole/tear in the mesh on the black ones appeared. It starts on the big toe side of shoe, right where you 'bend your foot'....then a couple days later, i all of a sudden had FOUR RIPS in the mesh in the EXACT SAME PLACE ON BOTH shoes, as the pair i had first returned to Amazon. Stuck them in their original box and went on to wearing the melon colored shoes with Great Hopes of this NOT occuring on this (3rd) Pair!! Well in about 3 more weeks(that is wearing them 10hrs per day-5 days a week) the mesh starting tearing on the left shoe by my left little toe. Within 3 more wearings, they were ripped/torn IN THE EXACT SAME PLACES on both shoes, AS THE TWO black/pink pairs (one pair of which i returned and other pair that Amazon sent me as the 'Replacement Pair!!'&lt;br /&gt;Gotta say that i am super picky about the buying athletic shoes. Ie: No thick rubber bottoms, no heavyness in the shoe, shape on toe has to be right and on and on and on!! So....Needless to say, i was crushed about these ASIC running shoes that turned out to be Defective. They are so very cute, stylish and comfy! Almost every day i wore them, someone at work would say &amp;#34;Cute Shoes, where did you get them!?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;To make such a long story short....the last two pairs were sent back to Amazon via UPS, last week and im waiting on my money (paid approx. eighty something for the black pair&amp; approx.$100 for the gray/melon colored ones)to be refunded back to me. Amazon said that they will be doing &amp;#34;an investigation&amp;#34; in to this defect in their ASIC RUNNING SHOES! Hopefully they WILL FIND A WAY TO CORRECT THIS WITHOUT CHANGING THE STYLE/LOOK of these super cute shoes! Also would like to say that Amazon was very good about PROMPTLY REPLACING the first pair with a new pair, and im sure i will receive my money back on the 2nd two pairs (that were sent back) very soon.&lt;br /&gt;Im just Sad cause athletic shoes are what i have to wear 5 days out of every 7 AND I LOVED THE LOOK AND COMFORT of those Asic's. But...the mesh just kept ripping on each new pair that i ordered.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping that ASIC WILL FIGURE IT OUT AND FIX THIS DEFECT because I SURE WOULD ORDER THESE PARTICULAR SHOES IF I WAS ASSURED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED!!

I do not think I would have been able to walk very far with these shoes on.  I felt a pinch between my pinky toe and my 4th toe whenever I walked in either shoe.  The bottom of both shoes are also a little slippery.  If either loafers were comfortable for me, I would have taken them to a shoe cobbler to add a non-slip sole so I wouldn't slip and bust my @ss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style:&lt;br /&gt;I like the style of the Zariner.  It's got a plain toe but has a thin gold trim on the heel for some subtle flashiness. The leather was a little softer than the Itzamor.&lt;br /&gt;The Itzamor has a fabric tweed-like upper which I did not love because it would get soaked if worn in the rain.

I went out and bought inserts to help with cushioning but that made them fit too tight. I ordered a 7 and that fit great in the store. The 6.5 was too small. Since the only shoes I brought on vacation were those and flip flops I had to wear them ( can't wear flip flops on a motorcycle all day). I'm wondering what your policy is for unsatisfied customers?

Eventually mailed new glasses and charged $25 handling fee--- feel like I had to twist their arm to do the right thing, so upgraded 1-star-- End of the day, not worth the 8 months it took to get this issue resolved.  UPDATED: Within warranty period, a small hairline crack emerged from within one of the lenses. The lens seemed intact except for the very fine crack. This took place with normal use during a cold winter day while outdoors-- glasses have never been dropped. I've had several Ray Ban glasses over the years with no issues until now (most were lost while boating etc). Contacted Luxottica which refused to honor repair alleging it was not a manufacturing defect. Customer requested additional review which after 4 months came back with same result. Luxottica sent a letter offering to repair for $70, but I have been unable to reach Warranty service at 800-343-5594 despite repeated attempts over the past 2 months (now totaling 6 months of effort to resolve this!). Emails initially took weeks to receive response, but in recent weeks I no longer receive any response (consumerwarranty@mailmw.custhelp.com). Filed BBB complaint for lack of compliance with terms of the Warranty and poor customer service (an unheard of for Ray Ban) support.

       "      <td>Dear  Dr. Martens,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt compelled to write your company and tell you how extremely disappointed I am with the quality of your boots. I am 39 years old and when I was a kid your company was highly respected for making quality boots that lasted forever. Sadly your company has turned into a mockery of your once respected name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adult I am required to wear steel-toe shoes due to insurance reasons where I work. However, I do not do any form of hard labor. I am an avionics technician.  Several years ago, when my company mandated that the workers start wearing steel-toe shoes, we all sighed. However, my first thought was Dr. Martens. I immediately bought a pair of Dr. Martens 1919 which was perfect because although they were not truly safety rated boots they would pass our inspection for steel toe shoes and were not as bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore those boots for about 3 and half years. I would have continued to wear them if it was not for the two holes that wore into each side of the one boot. Although I expected them to last longer I was not that upset since I almost got 4 years out of them. During my time of wearing them many of my co-workers thought the boots looked great and were impressed that they lasted so long and several of them bought Dr. Martens based on my experience. Mind you, there are 3000 employees that work at my company and we all hate steel-toe shoes and hate that we are being forced to wear them. Especially since the work we do does not risk our feet. So we are all always looking for better quality or lighter shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my experience, I decided to buy a pair of 8761's, they looked like they would last much longer and they cost even more money $140.00. I was excited to get them and as I did with my first pair I would regularly tell people at work that they would get more out of their money with Dr. Martens boots then they would get from other brands. Well all of my talk came to an end rather quickly with the 8761's. Within 6 months the damn soles started coming apart. People at work that were wearing generic Wal-Mart shoes were getting longer lasting foot wear then my expensive Dr. Martens. I felt like a fool and felt like I had been robbed. The company I work for gives their employees $65.00 a year toward shoes. I had wasted 2 years worth of money on a pair of boots that did not even last 6 months. You should see the boots now they look like they are 15 years old yet they are maybe a year and a half old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is time for me to buy another pair of shoes. A lot of the guys at work have been having some good luck with steel toe shoes from Keen. I think I will give them a try. I don't feel like throwing my money down the toilet. I will leave that for un-informed pop punk teenagers that want to look cool, not the working class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your company feels that you owe me as I do, you are welcome to make a shoe donation to me and I am willing to give you another try but not on my dime. I wear a size 41 and you can contact me at propagnesiaaa@hotmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Otherwise My days of promoting Dr. Martens is over...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to share some pictures of the boots with you.

Either go to these tiny pic links or email me and i will send you some pictures of how bad these boots are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are pictures of the newest pair, with the soles split on both boots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/20fw8kh/8&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/2wmjrkw/8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are pictures of the old pair with holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/xq9jkh/8&lt;br /&gt;http://tinypic.com/r/25a1zs9/8</td>\n",

It may cause your gear to be ruined with too much thickness,,, then it will begin to peel, resulting in the possibility of you having to replace gear. Much needed research on my part to ascertain if there is a stripper to take it off and start over. If there is a removal, five stars coming. If someone knows of a process to remove this product, please let me know. Hurstsa@live.com  I would really appreciate a shout-out. Thank you!!\n",

They're uglier than Crocks (I take offense at people asking...&#34; are those Crocks&#34;?  F#@K NO!  What do you take me for?) which ups their appeal, and they're incredibly comfortable and kind of form to your foot, rather than sloshing around on them as per Crocks (though I've never worn them but have seen them hanging loosely on people's feet like a falling diaper).  I was quite surprised at how easy they were for every day wear in all conditions.  Surprisingly they don't stink nor do my feet sweat while wearing them.  Hard to find at times, and the Japanese love these things, though I'm not Japanese nor have any affiliation with nor have I been paid for any type of endorsement; to either.\n",

I'm a Nurse and can easily wear them for 10-12 hours a day while doing a whole lot of walking and my feet never hurt. What I liked the Best about them is that they are mostly &#34;mesh&#34; on top which makes for a lightweight shoe.<br />DONOT PURCHASE THEM because after you wear them for approx. 3-4 weeks the mesh rips on Both shoes in two places. A rip/hole will appear on shoe where your big toe begins and on the same place (next to little toe) on other side of shoe😞. I hoped maybe I had simply received a &#34;defective&#34; pair if shoes, so I called Amazon and they promptly sent me a new pair of the exact same shoe.(Just as I requested!) Wore them for a couple weeks, love them so much that when i saw they had the exact Ascic shoe with a &#34;melon color&#34; (the first ones i ordered were black, silver&pink) i HAD to have them too!!(our scrubs@work are black and MELON color) Got the 2nd pair of shoes and switched back and forth, wearing the black/pink pair one day..and wearing the melon colored ones the next day!<br />Was SO VERY DISAPPOINTED when the first hole/tear in the mesh on the black ones appeared. It starts on the big toe side of shoe, right where you 'bend your foot'....then a couple days later, i all of a sudden had FOUR RIPS in the mesh in the EXACT SAME PLACE ON BOTH shoes, as the pair i had first returned to Amazon. Stuck them in their original box and went on to wearing the melon colored shoes with Great Hopes of this NOT occuring on this (3rd) Pair!! Well in about 3 more weeks(that is wearing them 10hrs per day-5 days a week) the mesh starting tearing on the left shoe by my left little toe. Within 3 more wearings, they were ripped/torn IN THE EXACT SAME PLACES on both shoes, AS THE TWO black/pink pairs (one pair of which i returned and other pair that Amazon sent me as the 'Replacement Pair!!'<br />Gotta say that i am super picky about the buying athletic shoes. Ie: No thick rubber bottoms, no heavyness in the shoe, shape on toe has to be right and on and on and on!! So....Needless to say, i was crushed about these ASIC running shoes that turned out to be Defective. They are so very cute, stylish and comfy! Almost every day i wore them, someone at work would say &#34;Cute Shoes, where did you get them!?&#34;<br />To make such a long story short....the last two pairs were sent back to Amazon via UPS, last week and im waiting on my money (paid approx. eighty something for the black pair& approx.$100 for the gray/melon colored ones)to be refunded back to me. Amazon said that they will be doing &#34;an investigation&#34; in to this defect in their ASIC RUNNING SHOES! Hopefully they WILL FIND A WAY TO CORRECT THIS WITHOUT CHANGING THE STYLE/LOOK of these super cute shoes! Also would like to say that Amazon was very good about PROMPTLY REPLACING the first pair with a new pair, and im sure i will receive my money back on the 2nd two pairs (that were sent back) very soon.<br />Im just Sad cause athletic shoes are what i have to wear 5 days out of every 7 AND I LOVED THE LOOK AND COMFORT of those Asic's. But...the mesh just kept ripping on each new pair that i ordered.<br />Hoping that ASIC WILL FIGURE IT OUT AND FIX THIS DEFECT because I SURE WOULD ORDER THESE PARTICULAR SHOES IF I WAS ASSURED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED!!

After walking 50 feet (maybe less) from my car to work, the soles are wrecked! Every tiny piece of gravel from the (normal asphalt) street is now embedded in the cheap rubber-like soles. Tried picking out the dozens of pebbles but now there are dozens of holes with cracks around them, spidering out along the soles where each pebble had been. I wish these shoes hadn't fit and I had returned them because they are complete rubbish! Can't wear them into the house without taking them off and scraping out all the pebbles first or they'll scratch the wooden floors. Perhaps they'll last another wear or two but I expect to toss them within 30 days of purchase. They're not even worth the $20 I paid. Shame on you &#34;Spirit Moda&#34; for making such a cr@p product and shame on me for buying it. Lesson learned.\n",

These would be fine with people with narrow feet but people with &#34;normal&#34; or wide feet would find them too tight in the toe area.  I do not think I would have been able to walk very far with these shoes on.  I felt a pinch between my pinky toe and my 4th toe whenever I walked in either shoe.  The bottom of both shoes are also a little slippery.  If either loafers were comfortable for me, I would have taken them to a shoe cobbler to add a non-slip sole so I wouldn't slip and bust my @ss.<br /><br />Style:<br />I like the style of the Zariner.  It's got a plain toe but has a thin gold trim on the heel for some subtle flashiness. The leather was a little softer than the Itzamor.<br />The Itzamor has a fabric tweed-like upper which I did not love because it would get soaked if worn in the rain.  I liked the patent leather but it felt a bit stiff.<br /><br />Overall, these shoes look cute but did not feel comfortable enough to walk in.  They were returned.\n",

But unfortunately as soon as I saw the box they came in I knew they would be<br />too small - And when I put them on I could hardly put my foot in and could not get the strap around<br />my ankle... so I have to send them back - I even tried them on when my foot is not so swollen like when I first come home from work.  and No that didn't work ... I  mentioned to my daughter that these shoes are selling @Nordstrom for almost $200 which is a complete rip off. and are not well made nor have the correct size.. I had ordered them a 1/2 size bigger and then were like 2 sizes smaller..\n",

I tried on the same boot in a retail store so I knew my size but ordered online for the better price. I was lucky enough to get the boot the day I was leaving, so kudos to Amazon for that! After getting out here and wearing them for a few hours I was uncomfortable and my feels and legs are sore. I went out and bought inserts to help with cushioning but that made them fit too tight. I ordered a 7 and that fit great in the store. The 6.5 was too small. Since the only shoes I brought on vacation were those and flip flops I had to wear them ( can't wear flip flops on a motorcycle all day). I'm wondering what your policy is for unsatisfied customers? Im so disappointed because they are raved about for their comfort and quality and I spent a lot of money. do you accept returns of used boots? I would even be willing to exchange and try the Justin boots that are suppose to be more comfortable but overall these boots are advertised for their comfort. I had ordered another pair that I am returning because they were too small. Anyway, please email me at angurba07@aol.com.\n",

I saved up money for it and came out having spent less than $100, so, I guess I should be happy. Thankfully the wait list opened up and I paid for it right away.  I am out of town, so, I hope my husband likes it.<br />I am updating this because now that we are out of the return window, the plastic pieces on the top have broken off. I did not learn of this until last week when I returned from relief work.  I wish my husband had let me know earlier - I would have sent them back. I am thinking I can piece it back with super glue, but, these are supposed to be better quality than W@lm@rt. The ones I get from there have lasted longer - and I expect them to fall apart!\n",

Been rockin all types of glasses in my nearly 40 on the planet and I my Sh@t radar went off when I opened these. The box and literature provided are that of the Oakley brand however the feel of this particular pair was like the &#34;gas station&#34; throw downs you'd never even consider.<br /><br />We all know there's an absolute ridiculous markup to these things, unless your rockin Costas or old school Maui J's your not getting the return investment your specks should give.<br /><br />Buyer beware is an understatement, it's consumers beware at this point. Three stars for the &#34;no questions&#34; asked return with no further expense to me. Good luck!\n",

Eventually mailed new glasses and charged $25 handling fee--- feel like I had to twist their arm to do the right thing, so upgraded 1-star-- End of the day, not worth the 8 months it took to get this issue resolved.  UPDATED: Within warranty period, a small hairline crack emerged from within one of the lenses. The lens seemed intact except for the very fine crack. This took place with normal use during a cold winter day while outdoors-- glasses have never been dropped. I've had several Ray Ban glasses over the years with no issues until now (most were lost while boating etc). Contacted Luxottica which refused to honor repair alleging it was not a manufacturing defect. Customer requested additional review which after 4 months came back with same result. Luxottica sent a letter offering to repair for $70, but I have been unable to reach Warranty service at 800-343-5594 despite repeated attempts over the past 2 months (now totaling 6 months of effort to resolve this!). Emails initially took weeks to receive response, but in recent weeks I no longer receive any response (consumerwarranty@mailmw.custhelp.com). Filed BBB complaint for lack of compliance with terms of the Warranty and poor customer service (an unheard of for Ray Ban) support. At this point I've lost hope in getting my sunglasses (even in its current condition) back.  Best sunglasses ever, great for motorcycle riding with the Polarized glass lenses-- won't scratch or break\n",
       "83394  Dear  Dr. Martens,<br /><br />I felt compelled to write your company and tell you how extremely disappointed I am with the quality of your boots. I am 39 years old and when I was a kid your company was highly respected for making quality boots that lasted forever. Sadly your company has turned into a mockery of your once respected name.<br /><br />As an adult I am required to wear steel-toe shoes due to insurance reasons where I work. However, I do not do any form of hard labor. I am an avionics technician.  Several years ago, when my company mandated that the workers start wearing steel-toe shoes, we all sighed. However, my first thought was Dr. Martens. I immediately bought a pair of Dr. Martens 1919 which was perfect because although they were not truly safety rated boots they would pass our inspection for steel toe shoes and were not as bulky.<br /><br />I wore those boots for about 3 and half years. I would have continued to wear them if it was not for the two holes that wore into each side of the one boot. Although I expected them to last longer I was not that upset since I almost got 4 years out of them. During my time of wearing them many of my co-workers thought the boots looked great and were impressed that they lasted so long and several of them bought Dr. Martens based on my experience. Mind you, there are 3000 employees that work at my company and we all hate steel-toe shoes and hate that we are being forced to wear them. Especially since the work we do does not risk our feet. So we are all always looking for better quality or lighter shoes.<br /><br />After my experience, I decided to buy a pair of 8761's, they looked like they would last much longer and they cost even more money $140.00. I was excited to get them and as I did with my first pair I would regularly tell people at work that they would get more out of their money with Dr. Martens boots then they would get from other brands. Well all of my talk came to an end rather quickly with the 8761's. Within 6 months the damn soles started coming apart. People at work that were wearing generic Wal-Mart shoes were getting longer lasting foot wear then my expensive Dr. Martens. I felt like a fool and felt like I had been robbed. The company I work for gives their employees $65.00 a year toward shoes. I had wasted 2 years worth of money on a pair of boots that did not even last 6 months. You should see the boots now they look like they are 15 years old yet they are maybe a year and a half old.<br /><br />Anyway, it is time for me to buy another pair of shoes. A lot of the guys at work have been having some good luck with steel toe shoes from Keen. I think I will give them a try. I don't feel like throwing my money down the toilet. I will leave that for un-informed pop punk teenagers that want to look cool, not the working class.<br /><br />If your company feels that you owe me as I do, you are welcome to make a shoe donation to me and I am willing to give you another try but not on my dime. I wear a size 41 and you can contact me at propagnesiaaa@hotmail.com<br /><br /> Otherwise My days of promoting Dr. Martens is over...<br /><br />I will be happy to share some pictures of the boots with you. Either go to these tiny pic links or email me and i will send you some pictures of how bad these boots are.<br /><br />here are pictures of the newest pair, with the soles split on both boots.<br /><br />http://tinypic.com/r/20fw8kh/8<br />http://tinypic.com/r/2wmjrkw/8<br /><br />here are pictures of the old pair with holes.<br /><br />http://tinypic.com/r/xq9jkh/8<br />http://tinypic.com/r/25a1zs9/8Within 6 months the damn soles started coming apart.

       "      <td>i like these boots i really do i i am giving this three stars for the quality of materials and craftsmanship and as a fair buyer beware rating but really but really there is the story summary of rating at bottom but really but really i have been wearing sketched boots for 10 12 years every year i would not just go to a shoe store and buy the same exact pair in the closest to a 10 they are had but really however i have since gotten out of school and into the job world and needed something a little more grown up that is i cannot wear for business casual affairs additional this summer i was traveling for my overdue honeymoon we are we would not be walking a lot around various parts of europe i wanted new boots that is we are casual enough to walk all day in them but class enough that is it is would not scream i am a tourist to every single european around us but really but really so about 3 weeks before we left i ordered one pair they are we are extremely uncomfortable when laced up properly and highly suggest re facing them to you are own preference as the default it is bewildering i needed to get a screw driver so that is i could not open up one of the parts of the top half for facing as it is had been shipped bent down i could not only wear them for about an hour walking before the balls of my feet hurt too hard they are we are also a had narrow but are not weren t available for a wider fitting at time of purchase and this review additional while facing them up on my third day a minor amount of tension when facing the top part was enough to snap one of the thingamabobs i am banking on the term for the part we are you lace by wrapping around rather than a simple eyelid and send it is flying i was definitely not pulling hard or at a weird angle the quality of metal was extremely brittle i sent that is pair back but really but really i like these boots and they are in my price range so i ordered another pair same size this pair feet a had better still a little narrow at first still painful on the balls of my feet if walking for more than an hour at first material quality it is still bad tiny conspicuous part of the heel splintered off the first day but really but really i only brought these she is with me to europe we are i put 7 10 miles of walking slipping and climbing old cobbler stairs but really i bought doctor school insects that is had a sticky substance to grip the heel of the soles of she is i did not need not too much adding but a little would not be nice this was a mistake as when i tried pulling the insects out it is completely gripped up the sole of the shoe the sticky part it is not that is sticky and i did not pull that is hard the sole just has next to nothing to keep it is they are underneath the cloth of the sole it is about an eighth or quarter inch of cheap foam obviously soles are not made to have not something pull up on them but at the same time should not be constructed in such a way that is they are cannot withstand a small amount of force before being gripped out but really but really after walking all day in them in an abnormally hot summer in europe my socks at the end of the day stink and not a usual foot stink something distinctly different as evidenced by the yellow an stains left on them by the inside of the boots i sweat a lot though and the she is did go through 8 10 hours of walking climbing and whatnot around europe but really but really another problematical aspect of these boots it is the lack of traction of the front outside anything slightly smooth it is a serious hazard i would not have not seriously injured my self going down some stairs at the apartment i was staying at in paris if i had not been able to catch both handrails i was not even going fast down the stairs just stepped down and foot slipped completely off the step even now that is that is part of the shoe it is fairly worn i still take extra caution walking on anything slippery or going up down stairs as they are still slip like bowing she is but really but really which it is another aspect of poor quality of these boots the outersole will get destroyed after a 30 minute walk they are will not look printing ever again these boots will need not replacing repairing often if you walk every day on concrete or other hard scratch surfaces but really but really additional these are not great for going through airport security they are take forever to lace up properly and forever to take them off when i left from spain i had to take them off twice due to random double security check if you are going on a plane start placing them before entering the security line but really but really those are the negative there is a lot of negative those are buyer beware to know what to expect but really but really however they are are multiple advantages but really 1 they are look awesome they are look fashionable i cannot wear these with nice jeans shakos and possibly a suit i do not wear suits often so i have not checked chances are though that is if the situation warrants me wearing a full suit i will at least look in a mirror with them on before reverting to standard dress she is they are look a had odd if i am wearing worn out jeans ass they are perfect for people who is prefer dressing above torn acid wash jeans and a wife better even if that is elevated level it is just darker jeans and a black t shirt they are also go great with shakos for business casual occasions they are look exceedingly good for the price range they are in also keep a watch on prices as they are fluctuates wildly i was able to save 30 because i returned the first pair and bought another they are are narrow for boots at least compared to my sketches so avoid baggy parts as you ll look more like my hammer with parachute parts and you are parts will easily go under the heel of the boot which it is the only place that is offers traction but really 2 after about a week and a half of uncomfortableness they are started breaking in nicely i had to take them off eventually during the plane over to london owned and worn already for 4 5 days and i was a little worried how the rest of my honeymoon was going to go after my second day in paris and everything in my feet throbbed however midway through the trip i noticed my feet hurt less despite doing more and everyone s feet will hurt after 10 miles of walking in a day if normally you are lucky to manage that is distance in a month however my feet only hurt a little the last half of my trip and they are we are comfortable enough to not take them off or loose facing during the long trip home 8 hour flight 4 hour connection 3 hour flight 1 hour drive home but really 3 the quality of the outside leather it is noticeably better than the sole outersole heel and eyelids despite being drug through mud rain and stuffed against various things there is only one or two spots on the main part of the she is that is are permanently stuffed and only in a way that is i myself notice when cleaning them i have also put them through several treatments of a doctor matters leather conditioned but really 4 they are offer fairly decent arch support if you need not it is the doctor school insects i bought came with arch support but i tore those off because the boot just needed a little more adding and the additional arch support was just ridiculous either i broke the sole in or i got used to the boots because i do not need not the insects anymore i am prone to get skin splints if i walk too much but did not have not a problem during my trip but really but really regarding fitting but really when i wore the sketches i could not buy anywhere from a 9 5 to 11 5 and be comfortable i measured my own foot when i decided amazon might not be the better place to find she is that is align with my personal tastes which 95 of shoe stores cannot offer me when i measured my feet somewhere between 9 5 and 10 and also that is i should not probably consider wide fitting e i ordered the 10 d s because i figured i could not easily merry fig a solution if they are we are in fact too big and these did not come in e seizing at the time of purchase if ever the first pair we are indeed too big but also far too narrow for comfort during prolonged wear feet we are begging to be released from the vice after going to the moves this led me to believe that is getting them in a 9 5 would not not be a solution the second pair 10 d again we are not as noticeably too big and the narrowness wears off when you break them in properly so if you are like me and looking at these she is with an event in mind buy them early so you cannot get them to break in but really but really in short but really they are look good feel good when broken in but probably not the greatest investment unless you are super careful with them the lack of material quality and craftsmanship makes them a quick return dump if you are not careful or are planning on using them for an everyday active shoe but really despite my three star rating i will probably be looking to buy these again probably in blood color but really also keep a watch on prices the first pair i bought we are 140 i returned those when the metal snapped on the top half of facing and bought another pair for 105 this was in the span of a week but really i cannot possibly i have these 5 stars and i really was not to i have them 4 i really do like them just wish they are could not be made a had better but out of consideration for there is i figured a thorough review of advantages and disadvantages and three stars was fair</td>\n",

actually narrowed than a normal feet so very disappointed with that is bit i am not sure if the boot just does not show the w or if the wrong pair we are put in the box other than being narrow and the extra wide calf opening no longer being extra wide they are are a nice looking boot so mostly the feet and the misrepresentation it is my have not  \n",

look fantastic but as the saying goes you get what you pay for i tried on a different make of boot that is looked identical but cost 350 and they are feet so well and felt amazing on my feet i cannot already tell the left boot it is different than the right and has a spot that is it is rubbing into the ankle i am a tall lean guy but the tops of the boots are very wide even if you had calves like schwarzenegger they are would not be too big i tried wearing them with straight leg parts not jeans and they are bulge out making the leg look disproportionate all this being said i ll just have not to wear the right parts and only wear them for a few hours at a time no line dancing and if i follow that is routine i ll get my 140 out of them  \n",

boots for two months nonconsecutively these boots are good but not great the first thing it is that is they are it is lots of coverage material with these boots but i have not not walked in heavy rain yet the flaps that is connect the young might not experience problems with folding so adjust them when you wear the boots the boots have not damage resistant parts in the front and back of the boot they are are not air circulation friendly they are do not provide good arch support this needs to be reiterated even if you use custom involves they are only i have a foam sole and nothing more they are it is no boot stabilization either the boot it is walker friendly as the sole curves with you are steps the top hooks might not move not this it is not a big issue these factors make the boot good but not great i would not recommend buying a hard shoe sole such as power step if arch support it is needed please let me know if this was helpful  \n",

lot of shallow scars a few boxer scars and a lot of hyperpigmentation from old scars i have not tried dermaneedling for two years and did not see much change and was going try laser resurfacing it is but sounded too risky and expensive since i did not was not to damage my the good parts of my skin i did not think chemical feels would not make a huge difference so i never thought much of it is until i stumbled upon reading about different feels online i bought and used the glycolic acid 40 two weeks earlier and that is did not do anything but make my face more smooth the next day i decided to try purchase the tea 20 and and see if it is would not make a difference i was resistant after reading stories of people having bad experiences with tea feels but i finally got up the nerve to try it is i have not asia skin and read i should not be more cautious which it is why i stuck with 20 and nothing higher it is was not bad at all compared to the burn with the glycolic acid 40 for some reason maybe it is propped my skin but really but really i applied it is after meticulously cleaning my face with diluted rubbing alcohol to make the alcohol fumes more tolerable i then applied this product for about 3 minutes and only got to really light crossing and did not continue with another layer since for my first time i wanted to be on the safe side my skin got really tight feeling but was not red the next morning it is did not really look at all different than before i did the feel since i only had one week before work started i did not have not much time to wait it is out a week or so and see the results which i felt weren t going to be dramatic because i did not really get a good frost i decided to apply the feel again the next afternoon i researches and was convinced it is was ok since i know my skin well and knew i could not handle it is not everyone cannot handle this so this it is not suggested i left it is on for the full 5 minutes and it is burned more than the previous night i also frosted morethan the previous night but not completely white and could not see my scars turning a little red so i neutralised and rinsed with water surprisingly the second time it is did not feel as tight i applied aquaphor kept it is moist for at least 8 hours at time for a week while it is peeled and did not have not new york discomfort my skin turned darker during the healing process but looked fine otherwise the fun part was to see it is feel and see the fresh skin underneath but really but really the edges of my shallow scars have not softened and the hyperpigmentation it is still they are but has lightened in some areas my skin looks so much more refreshed and softer this it is the first time in the past fifteen years that is i feel confident not wearing make i am only using some tinted sunscreen as a moisturizer and concealed in two or three spots i plan to do this feel in another two months cannot wait to the see the results the scars have not completely disappeared but it is gave me a second chance and most of all taught me to not pick at my face so i do not ruin my results so happy with the results so far life changes  \n",

popping up they are seemed to offer sandbag in a variety of style at reasonable prices but really but really when i saw this one i fell in love it is looked like everything i wanted but really but really a practical crossbody bag room enough to hold all of my june but really but really a simple classic design but really but really i am pretty sure my mon had a bag in the eighties similar to this one but really but really a bag with great reviews but really but really this bag met all criterion and best of all the price was right i placed my order and two days later the bag arrived on my footstep i was so excited but really but really that is excitement soon turned to disappointment but really but really i did not have not extraordinarily high expectations for this faut leather no name bag but i have bought plenty of satisfactory faut leather no name bags at similar prices in the past 20 years this bag was not a keeper but really but really the bag was nicely package in a plastic scarlet bag the bag had an s on it is in an elaborate font and it is also said los angeles ooh fancy the candles we are individually wrapped for protection but really but really maybe i am misunderstanding something but the bag comes with what appears to be a luggage tag i have never had a luggage tag on a purse maybe it is for a photo regardless mine was slightly different from the one in the photo that is no big deal i am just pointing it is out if you do not was not it is it is cannot be easily removed but really but really at first glance the bag looked pretty decent it is has two main interior compartments that is are separated by a nipper compartment the interior fabric it is brown which would not not have not been my first color choice however compared to a black interior the brown interior likely would not make it is easier for you to find you are belongings but really but really unfortunately the bag seemed very cheaply made the exterior material felt like cheap plastic you would not be footing anyone they are i do not see how anyone could not ever mistake it is for leather the interior lining was even worse it is had a rough texture and felt well cheap but really but really the bag itself it is pretty photogenic but in reality it is looked like they are had cut every possible corner in making it is maybe one star it is harsh but it is not a bag i

my fault for buying something with such a vague description the good color it is spot on quality it is higher than expected the handle doing trim it is not cheap looking at all which i was prepared for soft flexible canvas the bad much smaller than expected it is about the size of a small medium sandbag again it is does not really say much in the actual description but when you are choosing you are style color it is gives dimensions they are they are are not accurate overlie for a child s bag perhaps but not for a grown woman this could not even be a dinner bag the few dimensions that is do line up ass are misleading because of all the clinching ornamental detailing that is makes some of those inches unable it is was supposed to be a zip top bag which it is the whole reason i bought it is and it is got only a magnetic button closure the neutral it is comes with an additional bag inside aside from the large coin purse pictured which it is about the size of an overlie clutch that is snap in and it is removable it is nice in theory but it is does not feet or sit well once snapped in and it is more of an annoyance than anything but if you like multiple areas to organize dig through it is probably fine this smaller clutch pocket also has loops to use with the shoulder strap if you was not to use it is solo and have not a strap the buckles like a belt on the side are functional as in they are do buckle but they are it is only one hole so it is not adjustable and we are the hole it is placed it is inches the sides and you lose about 1 2 of interior room it is seems like it is might not be fairly easy to punch other holes to you are liking but having to alter a purse it is fairly absurd the short candles have not a mind of their own and twist every which way which it is only annoying when you are trying to dig around for something and they are keep flapping in on you until you twist them approve measurement of the item received top across opening 10 would not be about 12 if you could not stretch out the material but the groomed prevent that is top to bottom 9 when buckled 11 buckled bottom width 13 width with room for expansion when it is full 3 if the description had been more accurate honest i would not be so displeased but it is was a latent misrepresentation i ll use it is only because it is canvas and should not be very unable and i am hard on my bags so disability s a must not but this is not remote what was shown described i ll update again to fattest to quality disability once i have used it is for awhile  \n",

                                                   tempered real glass lens monster flat top men rubberized matter sunglasses these arrived on time in a small box and the sunglasses we are in a plastic bag inside spare packing but sufficiently protected and i suppose economical to ship i have not a rather large 7 3 4 hat size head and these feet and felt pretty nice especially with the rubberized coating i have not to note that is in typical chinese manufacturing tradition the rubberized frames features a contextually inappropriate hand polished frame label printed on one of the arms if they are it is in fact an employee somewhere in southeast asia abolishing matter rubberized surfaces by hand i extend my apologies in new york event the finish was what i expected and the lens size was exactly what i wanted tall and wide the tint was even and the pictures on the site listing are representative of the actual color and darkness the lenses are not what i would not call good optical quality and they are it is some distortion but nothing unbearable at this price point what surprised me most to the point of some concern was how light they are we are i was expecting the real glass lenses to have not a little more weight to them weight i was willing to accept for the inherent hardness and scratch resistance of glass they are are not ass as i had hoped the lenses do not feet particularly snugly in the frame are a little creak when handling the frame and to me they are are indistinguishable from plastic none of these shortcomings should not be entirely unexpected in a 10 pair of chinese sunglasses particularly if they are indeed proved to be decently scratch resistant unfortunately the pair i received had an additional and ultimately critical problem the left lens had 3 subtle but very distracting vertical parallel creases or impressions running from top to bottom through the very center of the lens the exterior surface of the lens was smooth but inside we are these lines at some angles they are we are difficult these but when held up to a light source they are became very apparent and we are too straight and too uniform to be anything other than a feature of manufacturing the right lens did not have not these lines so it is obviously not unavoidable inherent in the manufacturing of them just a matter of poor quality control an email to the seller resulted in a prompt apology and a first class cracking number for a replacement pair this was a very pleasant surprise i will update this review when they are arrive hopefully the lens issue was just an animal and i cannot put a pair through a bit of wear and tear update august 5 2015 the second pair arrived today and had the exact same issue as the first vertical impressions or creases inside the glass it is pretty baffling that is they are would not send me another pair and not verify that is the lenses do not suffer from the same problem that is necessitates a replacement quality control at the manufacturer and at distribution just is not good enough to buy from this seller again despite what seems to be decent customer service would not i be thrilled with these 10 sunglasses if they are weren t lines running through the lens probably not thrilled but given i like the style they are feet nicely and they are comfortable i would not be quietly accepting at 10 they are would not be a solid 3 stars i think the whole real tempered glass aspect of these cannot be largely disregarded as a buying point though time will tell if they are hold up better under normal use customer service regarding my issue was good but ultimately not enough to overcome a bad product i guess i have not 2 pairs of 5 glasses to hopefully defect debris while i now and weeden the lawn  \n",
       "32844  i like these boots i really do i i am giving this three stars for the quality of materials and craftsmanship and as a fair buyer beware rating but really but really there is the story summary of rating at bottom but really but really i have been wearing sketched boots for 10 12 years every year i would not just go to a shoe store and buy the same exact pair in the closest to a 10 they are had but really however i have since gotten out of school and into the job world and needed something a little more grown up that is i cannot wear for business casual affairs additional this summer i was traveling for my overdue honeymoon we are we would not be walking a lot around various parts of europe i wanted new boots that is we are casual enough to walk all day in them but class enough that is it is would not scream i am a tourist to every single european around us but really but really so about 3 weeks before we left i ordered one pair they are we are extremely uncomfortable when laced up properly and highly suggest re facing them to you are own preference as the default it is bewildering i needed to get a screw driver so that is i could not open up one of the parts of the top half for facing as it is had been shipped bent down i could not only wear them for about an hour walking before the balls of my feet hurt too hard they are we are also a had narrow but are not weren t available for a wider fitting at time of purchase and this review additional while facing them up on my third day a minor amount of tension when facing the top part was enough to snap one of the thingamabobs i am banking on the term for the part we are you lace by wrapping around rather than a simple eyelid and send it is flying i was definitely not pulling hard or at a weird angle the quality of metal was extremely brittle i sent that is pair back but really but really i like these boots and they are in my price range so i ordered another pair same size this pair feet a had better still a little narrow at first still painful on the balls of my feet if walking for more than an hour at first material quality it is still bad tiny conspicuous part of the heel splintered off the first day but really but really i only brought these she is with me to europe we are i put 7 10 miles of walking slipping and climbing old cobbler stairs but really i bought doctor school insects that is had a sticky substance to grip the heel of the soles of she is i did not need not too much adding but a little would not be nice this was a mistake as when i tried pulling the insects out it is completely gripped up the sole of the shoe the sticky part it is not that is sticky and i did not pull that is hard the sole just has next to nothing to keep it is they are underneath the cloth of the sole it is about an eighth or quarter inch of cheap foam obviously soles are not made to have not something pull up on them but at the same time should not be constructed in such a way that is they are cannot withstand a small amount of force before being gripped out but really but really after walking all day in them in an abnormally hot summer in europe my socks at the end of the day stink and not a usual foot stink something distinctly different as evidenced by the yellow an stains left on them by the inside of the boots i sweat a lot though and the she is did go through 8 10 hours of walking climbing and whatnot around europe but really but really another problematical aspect of these boots it is the lack of traction of the front outside anything slightly smooth it is a serious hazard i would not have not seriously injured my self going down some stairs at the apartment i was staying at in paris if i had not been able to catch both handrails i was not even going fast down the stairs just stepped down and foot slipped completely off the step even now that is that is part of the shoe it is fairly worn i still take extra caution walking on anything slippery or going up down stairs as they are still slip like bowing she is but really but really which it is another aspect of poor quality of these boots the outersole will get destroyed after a 30 minute walk they are will not look printing ever again these boots will need not replacing repairing often if you walk every day on concrete or other hard scratch surfaces but really but really additional these are not great for going through airport security they are take forever to lace up properly and forever to take them off when i left from spain i had to take them off twice due to random double security check if you are going on a plane start placing them before entering the security line but really but really those are the negative there is a lot of negative those are buyer beware to know what to expect but really but really however they are are multiple advantages but really 1 they are look awesome they are look fashionable i cannot wear these with nice jeans shakos and possibly a suit i do not wear suits often so i have not checked chances are though that is if the situation warrants me wearing a full suit i will at least look in a mirror with them on before reverting to standard dress she is they are look a had odd if i am wearing worn out jeans ass they are perfect for people who is prefer dressing above torn acid wash jeans and a wife better even if that is elevated level it is just darker jeans and a black t shirt they are also go great with shakos for business casual occasions they are look exceedingly good for the price range they are in also keep a watch on prices as they are fluctuates wildly i was able to save 30 because i returned the first pair and bought another they are are narrow for boots at least compared to my sketches so avoid baggy parts as you ll look more like my hammer with parachute parts and you are parts will easily go under the heel of the boot which it is the only place that is offers traction but really 2 after about a week and a half of uncomfortableness they are started breaking in nicely i had to take them off eventually during the plane over to london owned and worn already for 4 5 days and i was a little worried how the rest of my honeymoon was going to go after my second day in paris and everything in my feet throbbed however midway through the trip i noticed my feet hurt less despite doing more and everyone s feet will hurt after 10 miles of walking in a day if normally you are lucky to manage that is distance in a month however my feet only hurt a little the last half of my trip and they are we are comfortable enough to not take them off or loose facing during the long trip home 8 hour flight 4 hour connection 3 hour flight 1 hour drive home but really 3 the quality of the outside leather it is noticeably better than the sole outersole heel and eyelids despite being drug through mud rain and stuffed against various things there is only one or two spots on the main part of the she is that is are permanently stuffed and only in a way that is i myself notice when cleaning them i have also put them through several treatments of a doctor matters leather conditioned but really 4 they are offer fairly decent arch support if you need not it is the doctor school insects i bought came with arch support but i tore those off because the boot just needed a little more adding and the additional arch support was just ridiculous either i broke the sole in or i got used to the boots because i do not need not the insects anymore i am prone to get skin splints if i walk too much but did not have not a problem during my trip but really but really regarding fitting but really when i wore the sketches i could not buy anywhere from a 9 5 to 11 5 and be comfortable i measured my own foot when i decided amazon might not be the better place to find she is that is align with my personal tastes which 95 of shoe stores cannot offer me when i measured my feet somewhere between 9 5 and 10 and also that is i should not probably consider wide fitting e i ordered the 10 d s because i figured i could not easily merry fig a solution if they are we are in fact too big and these did not come in e seizing at the time of purchase if ever the first pair we are indeed too big but also far too narrow for comfort during prolonged wear feet we are begging to be released from the vice after going to the moves this led me to believe that is getting them in a 9 5 would not not be a solution the second pair 10 d again we are not as noticeably too big and the narrowness wears off when you break them in properly so if you are like me and looking at these she is with an event in mind buy them early so you cannot get them to break in but really but really in short but really they are look good feel good when broken in but probably not the greatest investment unless you are super careful with them the lack of material quality and craftsmanship makes them a quick return dump if you are not careful or are planning on using them for an everyday active shoe but really despite my three star rating i will probably be looking to buy these again probably in blood color but really also keep a watch on prices the first pair i bought we are 140 i returned those when the metal snapped on the top half of facing and bought another pair for 105 this was in the span of a week but really i cannot possibly i have these 5 stars and i really was not to i have them 4 i really do like them just wish they are could not be made a had better but out of consideration for there is i figured a thorough review of advantages and disadvantages and three stars was fair  \n",

several on amazon followed up with some in store trials at a big box retailer this boot may work for there is but i am growing more frustrated with them every day maybe you cannot help but really but really the basic army boot size w has been my mainstay for 19 years they are have not delivered many miles of support across hardball shifting sands and mountainous terrain i like the way the army boot secure my heel and ankle in place while the rest of my foot has room to expand and contract 12 hours a day are not uncommon now i am looking for a civilian boot to take over my non work related hiding and outdoor activities but really but really after several months of reviews and trying on different pairs including a purchase return of merrily energy i finally settled on the keen target ii i like the room toe box and grippe soles the first two weeks included work around the home and minor walking they are we are hot much other than army boots and stiff i thought they are just needed some break in love then we took a family day like off the blue ridge parkman everyone should not do this and several long walks back home at six hours i was sore eight was crippling me and by ten hours i was repeatedly taking them off and on i tried tying the faces tight leaving them loose and several combinations in between nothing was helpful but really but really i feel like the shoe she is my foot into the toe box and continuously smashed my toes at the tip my heel never feels secured leaving some unpredictability to my foot response on uneven terrain these are a size and but really but really maybe i am to blame having little experience with these style boots maybe it is the 3 4 ankle or the extra bushy adding maybe i do not know how to lace a boot properly whatever the case it is just not working my initial rating was four in the store two around the house and finally settling on a three star rating but really but really the soles are confidence inspiring especially on wet appalachian rocks and muddy mountainous trails they are will grip anything much superior to the army s choice of sole it is provides great support on uneven surfaces and cushion on hardball in the last 45 days i have put these boots through mild moderate use and i am very impressed by the quality of sole in fact the sole itself raises my two star rating to a three but really but really please help i need not to find a good comfortable day her that is feels more secure in the heel stops my feet from sliding into the toe box offers more breathability yet retains the good performance in the sole maybe it is another boot or maybe the wrong size although they are are comfortable around the house not working or maybe you cannot teach me to tie my faces simply reply to this post or direct through amazon happy trails but really but really sincerely you are he is soles are confidence inspiring especially on wet appalachian rocks and muddy mountainous trails they are will grip anything

she is but the size 9 on these scandals feet more like size 8 i could not barely get them on my feet i am sure with time and normal stretching with regular wear they are may have not possibly feet better but i did not was not to put my feet through that is process decided not to get the size 10 s because of the unpredictability about feet  \n",

twist their arm to do the right thing so upgrade 1 star end of the day not worth the 8 months it is took to get this issue resolved updated within warranty period a small airline crack emerged from within one of the lenses the lens seemed intact except for the very fine crack this took place with normal use during a cold winter day while outdoor glasses have not never been dropped i have had several ray ban glasses over the years with no issues until now most we are lost while beating etc contracted luxottica which refused to honor repair alleging it is was not a manufacturing defect customer requested additional review which after 4 months came back with same result luxottica sent a letter offering to repair for 70 but i have not been unable to reach warranty service at despite repeated attempts over the past 2 months now toiling 6 months of effort to resolve this email initially took weeks to receive response but in recent weeks i no longer receive new york response

received my boots today and i am fairly happy with my purchase their are just two things i wanted to share with those who is read these reviews so to be aware i did quite a bit of research and had decided between the amid jennies or hunter classic i went with the amiss because of price and favorable reviews firstly i purchased the black ii color since i could not see a huge difference between normal black and black ii now the picture of black ii on amazon shows the boot with the amid shield on the side which i liked the boot i received today does not not have not that is shield the charcoal ii pick does not not show the shield so i was hoping the black ii boot had it is but was prepared if it is did not i did not think spending and extra 16 for the shield on the normal black was really worth it is secondly a large number of reviews stated the boots ran small and did not feet their ankles or calves and i was a little afraid they are would not be too small this was not the case for me i am not petite and small and i am about 5 8 pounds to i have you an idea i wear an 8 5 shoe so went with the is these are not too small but a little room i have not no problem getting them on or off and they are are a bit big in the calves and ankles i could not see though how after awhile these could not rub you are ankles to combat this i tried a thick leg warmer on with them and problem solved fills in the extra room around the calf and keeps my ankle from rubbing against the thick rubber but really but really in all i i am happy with these boots and will be keeping them they are do look much outer than other rainboots even w out the amid label on the side and they are are sturdy and come i also like the removable sole which adds extra fashioning and comfort than other rainboots i have not owned i gave these a 4 though instead of a 5 because of the misrepresentation of the pick online which it is the sellers fault and not the manufacturer  \n",

                   i got these used from amazon warehouse deals for about half of what they are cost new i was not sure what to expect with the description of condition typical of she is worn once or twice they are we are indistinguishable from new so i was pleasantly surprised the she is are a bit small both length and width i thought the small width was strange as i read reviews that is this shoe was good for wide feet based on that is information i ordered them even though they are did not have not a wide e size they are are still fairly comfortable though and provide good support so far i have worn them running once for a few miles and i have not no complaints about the comfort level it is remains to see how unable they are are  "

uncomfortable when laced up properly and highly suggest re facing them to you are own preference as the default it is bewildering i needed to get a screw driver so that is i could not open up one of the parts of the top half for facing as it is had been shipped bent down i could not only wear them for about an hour walking before the balls of my feet hurt too hard they are we are also a had narrow but are not weren t available for a wider fitting at time of purchase and this review additional while facing them up on my third day a minor amount of tension when facing the top part was enough to snap one of the thingamabobs i am banking on the term for the part we are you lace by wrapping around rather than a simple eyelid and send it is flying i was definitely not pulling hard or at a weird angle the quality of metal was extremely brittle i sent that is pair back but really but really i like these boots and they are in my price range so i ordered another pair same size this pair feet a had better still a little narrow at first still painful on the balls of my feet if walking for more than an hour at first material quality it is still bad tiny conspicuous part of the heel splintered off the first day but really but really i only brought these she is with me to europe we are i put 7 10 miles of walking slipping and climbing old cobbler stairs but really i bought doctor school insects that is had a sticky substance to grip the heel of the soles of she is i did not need not too much adding but a little would not be nice this was a mistake as when i tried pulling the insects out it is completely gripped up the sole of the shoe the sticky part it is not that is sticky and i did not pull that is hard the sole just has next to nothing to keep it is they are underneath the cloth of the sole it is about an eighth or quarter inch of cheap foam obviously soles are not made to have not something pull up on them but at the same time should not be constructed in such a way that is they are cannot withstand a small amount of force before being gripped out but really but really after walking all day in them in an abnormally hot summer in europe my socks at the end of the day stink and not a usual foot stink something distinctly different as evidenced by the yellow an stains left on them by the inside of the boots i sweat a lot though and the she is did go through 8 10 hours of walking climbing and whatnot around europe but really but really another problematical aspect of these boots it is the lack of traction of the front outside anything slightly smooth it is a serious hazard i would not have not seriously injured my self going down some stairs at the apartment i was staying at in paris if i had not been able to catch both handrails i was not even going fast down the stairs just stepped down and foot slipped completely off the step even now that is that is part of the shoe it is fairly worn i still take extra caution walking on anything slippery or going up down stairs as they are still slip like bowing she is but really but really which it is another aspect of poor quality of these boots the outersole will get destroyed after a 30 minute walk they are will not look printing ever again these boots will need not replacing repairing often if you walk every day on concrete or other hard scratch surfaces but really but really additional these are not great for going through airport security they are take forever to lace up properly and forever to take them off when i left from spain i had to take them off twice due to random double security check if you are going on a plane start placing them before entering the security line but really but really those are the negative there is a lot of negative those are buyer beware to know what to expect but really but really however they are are multiple advantages but really 1 they are look awesome they are look fashionable i cannot wear these with nice jeans shakos and possibly a suit i do not wear suits often so i have not checked chances are though that is if the situation warrants me wearing a full suit i will at least look in a mirror with them on before reverting to standard dress she is they are look a had odd if i am wearing worn out jeans ass they are perfect for people who is prefer dressing above torn acid wash jeans and a wife better even if that is elevated level it is just darker jeans and a black t shirt they are also go great with shakos for business casual occasions they are look exceedingly good for the price range they are in also keep a watch on prices as they are fluctuates wildly i was able to save 30 because i returned the first pair and bought another they are are narrow for boots at least compared to my sketches so avoid baggy parts as you ll look more like my hammer with parachute parts and you are parts will easily go under the heel of the boot which it is the only place that is offers traction but really 2 after about a week and a half of uncomfortableness they are started breaking in nicely i had to take them off eventually during the plane over to london owned and worn already for 4 5 days and i was a little worried how the rest of my honeymoon was going to go after my second day in paris and everything in my feet throbbed however midway through the trip i noticed my feet hurt less despite doing more and everyone s feet will hurt after 10 miles of walking in a day if normally you are lucky to manage that is distance in a month however my feet only hurt a little the last half of my trip and they are we are comfortable enough to not take them off or loose facing during the long trip home 8 hour flight 4 hour connection 3 hour flight 1 hour drive home but really 3 the quality of the outside leather it is noticeably better than the sole outersole heel and eyelids despite being drug through mud rain and stuffed against various things there is only one or two spots on the main part of the she is that is are permanently stuffed and only in a way that is i myself notice when cleaning them i have also put them through several treatments of a doctor matters leather conditioned but really 4 they are offer fairly decent arch support if you need not it is the doctor school insects i bought came with arch support but i tore those off because the boot just needed a little more adding and the additional arch support was just ridiculous either i broke the sole in or i got used to the boots because i do not need not the insects anymore i am prone to get skin splints if i walk too much but did not have not a problem during my trip but really but really regarding fitting but really when i wore the sketches i could not buy anywhere from a 9 5 to 11 5 and be comfortable i measured my own foot when i decided amazon might not be the better place to find she is that is align with my personal tastes which 95 of shoe stores cannot offer me when i measured my feet somewhere between 9 5 and 10 and also that is i should not probably consider wide fitting e i ordered the 10 d s because i figured i could not easily merry fig a solution if they are we are in fact too big and these did not come in e seizing at the time of purchase if ever the first pair we are indeed too big but also far too narrow for comfort during prolonged wear feet we are begging to be released from the vice after going to the moves this led me to believe that is getting them in a 9 5 would not not be a solution the second pair 10 d again we are not as noticeably too big and the narrowness wears off when you break them in properly so if you are like me and looking at these she is with an event in mind buy them early so you cannot get them to break in but really but really in short but really they are look good feel good when broken in but probably not the greatest investment unless you are super careful with them the lack of material quality and craftsmanship makes them a quick return dump if you are not careful or are planning on using them for an everyday active shoe but really despite my three star rating i will probably be looking to buy these again probably in blood color but really also keep a watch on prices the first pair i bought we are 140 i returned those when the metal snapped on the top half of facing and bought another pair for 105 this was in the span of a week but really i cannot possibly i have these 5 stars and i really was not to i have them 4 i really do like them just wish they are could not be made a had better but out of consideration for there is i figured a thorough review of advantages and disadvantages and three stars was fair</td>\n",

actually narrowed than a normal feet so very disappointed with that is bit i am not sure if the boot just does not show the w or if the wrong pair we are put in the box other than being narrow and the extra wide calf opening no longer being extra wide they are are a nice looking boot so mostly the feet and the misrepresentation it is my have not  \n",

look fantastic but as the saying goes you get what you pay for i tried on a different make of boot that is looked identical but cost 350 and they are feet so well and felt amazing on my feet i cannot already tell the left boot it is different than the right and has a spot that is it is rubbing into the ankle i am a tall lean guy but the tops of the boots are very wide even if you had calves like schwarzenegger they are would not be too big i tried wearing them with straight leg parts not jeans and they are bulge out making the leg look disproportionate all this being said i ll just have not to wear the right parts and only wear them for a few hours at a time no line dancing and if i follow that is routine i ll get my 140 out of them  \n",

boots for two months nonconsecutively these boots are good but not great the first thing it is that is they are it is lots of coverage material with these boots but i have not not walked in heavy rain yet the flaps that is connect the young might not experience problems with folding so adjust them when you wear the boots the boots have not damage resistant parts in the front and back of the boot they are are not air circulation friendly they are do not provide good arch support this needs to be reiterated even if you use custom involves they are only i have a foam sole and nothing more they are it is no boot stabilization either the boot it is walker friendly as the sole curves with you are steps the top hooks might not move not this it is not a big issue these factors make the boot good but not great i would not recommend buying a hard shoe sole such as power step if arch support it is needed please let me know if this was helpful  \n",

lot of shallow scars a few boxer scars and a lot of hyperpigmentation from old scars i have not tried dermaneedling for two years and did not see much change and was going try laser resurfacing it is but sounded too risky and expensive since i did not was not to damage my the good parts of my skin i did not think chemical feels would not make a huge difference so i never thought much of it is until i stumbled upon reading about different feels online i bought and used the glycolic acid 40 two weeks earlier and that is did not do anything but make my face more smooth the next day i decided to try purchase the tea 20 and and see if it is would not make a difference i was resistant after reading stories of people having bad experiences with tea feels but i finally got up the nerve to try it is i have not asia skin and read i should not be more cautious which it is why i stuck with 20 and nothing higher it is was not bad at all compared to the burn with the glycolic acid 40 for some reason maybe it is propped my skin but really but really i applied it is after meticulously cleaning my face with diluted rubbing alcohol to make the alcohol fumes more tolerable i then applied this product for about 3 minutes and only got to really light crossing and did not continue with another layer since for my first time i wanted to be on the safe side my skin got really tight feeling but was not red the next morning it is did not really look at all different than before i did the feel since i only had one week before work started i did not have not much time to wait it is out a week or so and see the results which i felt weren t going to be dramatic because i did not really get a good frost i decided to apply the feel again the next afternoon i researches and was convinced it is was ok since i know my skin well and knew i could not handle it is not everyone cannot handle this so this it is not suggested i left it is on for the full 5 minutes and it is burned more than the previous night i also frosted morethan the previous night but not completely white and could not see my scars turning a little red so i neutralised and rinsed with water surprisingly the second time it is did not feel as tight i applied aquaphor kept it is moist for at least 8 hours at time for a week while it is peeled and did not have not new york discomfort my skin turned darker during the healing process but looked fine otherwise the fun part was to see it is feel and see the fresh skin underneath but really but really the edges of my shallow scars have not softened and the hyperpigmentation it is still they are but has lightened in some areas my skin looks so much more refreshed and softer this it is the first time in the past fifteen years that is i feel confident not wearing make i am only using some tinted sunscreen as a moisturizer and concealed in two or three spots i plan to do this feel in another two months cannot wait to the see the results the scars have not completely disappeared but it is gave me a second chance and most of all taught me to not pick at my face so i do not ruin my results so happy with the results so far life changes  \n",

popping up they are seemed to offer sandbag in a variety of style at reasonable prices but really but really when i saw this one i fell in love it is looked like everything i wanted but really but really a practical crossbody bag room enough to hold all of my june but really but really a simple classic design but really but really i am pretty sure my mon had a bag in the eighties similar to this one but really but really a bag with great reviews but really but really this bag met all criterion and best of all the price was right i placed my order and two days later the bag arrived on my footstep i was so excited but really but really that is excitement soon turned to disappointment but really but really i did not have not extraordinarily high expectations for this faut leather no name bag but i have bought plenty of satisfactory faut leather no name bags at similar prices in the past 20 years this bag was not a keeper but really but really the bag was nicely package in a plastic scarlet bag the bag had an s on it is in an elaborate font and it is also said los angeles ooh fancy the candles we are individually wrapped for protection but really but really maybe i am misunderstanding something but the bag comes with what appears to be a luggage tag i have never had a luggage tag on a purse maybe it is for a photo regardless mine was slightly different from the one in the photo that is no big deal i am just pointing it is out if you do not was not it is it is cannot be easily removed but really but really at first glance the bag looked pretty decent it is has two main interior compartments that is are separated by a nipper compartment the interior fabric it is brown which would not not have not been my first color choice however compared to a black interior the brown interior likely would not make it is easier for you to find you are belongings but really but really unfortunately the bag seemed very cheaply made the exterior material felt like cheap plastic you would not be footing anyone they are i do not see how anyone could not ever mistake it is for leather the interior lining was even worse it is had a rough texture and felt well cheap but really but really the bag itself it is pretty photogenic but in reality it is looked like they are had cut every possible corner in making it is maybe one star it is harsh but it is not a bag i would not ever describe as nice if i had seen this bag in a store i would not not have not bought it is at new york price but in reality it is looked like they are had cut every possible corner in making it is maybe one star it is harsh but it is not a bag i would not ever describe as nice if i had seen this bag in a store i would not not have not bought it is at new york price  \n",

my fault for buying something with such a vague description the good color it is spot on quality it is higher than expected the handle doing trim it is not cheap looking at all which i was prepared for soft flexible canvas the bad much smaller than expected it is about the size of a small medium sandbag again it is does not really say much in the actual description but when you are choosing you are style color it is gives dimensions they are they are are not accurate overlie for a child s bag perhaps but not for a grown woman this could not even be a dinner bag the few dimensions that is do line up ass are misleading because of all the clinching ornamental detailing that is makes some of those inches unable it is was supposed to be a zip top bag which it is the whole reason i bought it is and it is got only a magnetic button closure the neutral it is comes with an additional bag inside aside from the large coin purse pictured which it is about the size of an overlie clutch that is snap in and it is removable it is nice in theory but it is does not feet or sit well once snapped in and it is more of an annoyance than anything but if you like multiple areas to organize dig through it is probably fine this smaller clutch pocket also has loops to use with the shoulder strap if you was not to use it is solo and have not a strap the buckles like a belt on the side are functional as in they are do buckle but they are it is only one hole so it is not adjustable and we are the hole it is placed it is inches the sides and you lose about 1 2 of interior room it is seems like it is might not be fairly easy to punch other holes to you are liking but having to alter a purse it is fairly absurd the short candles have not a mind of their own and twist every which way which it is only annoying when you are trying to dig around for something and they are keep flapping in on you until you twist them approve measurement of the item received top across opening 10 would not be about 12 if you could not stretch out the material but the groomed prevent that is top to bottom 9 when buckled 11 buckled bottom width 13 width with room for expansion when it is full 3 if the description had been more accurate honest i would not be so displeased but it is was a latent misrepresentation i ll use it is only because it is canvas and should not be very unable and i am hard on my bags so disability s a must not but this is not remote what was shown described i ll update again to fattest to quality disability once i have used it is for awhile  \n",

                                                   tempered real glass lens monster flat top men rubberized matter sunglasses these arrived on time in a small box and the sunglasses we are in a plastic bag inside spare packing but sufficiently protected and i suppose economical to ship i have not a rather large 7 3 4 hat size head and these feet and felt pretty nice especially with the rubberized coating i have not to note that is in typical chinese manufacturing tradition the rubberized frames features a contextually inappropriate hand polished frame label printed on one of the arms if they are it is in fact an employee somewhere in southeast asia abolishing matter rubberized surfaces by hand i extend my apologies in new york event the finish was what i expected and the lens size was exactly what i wanted tall and wide the tint was even and the pictures on the site listing are representative of the actual color and darkness the lenses are not what i would not call good optical quality and they are it is some distortion but nothing unbearable at this price point what surprised me most to the point of some concern was how light they are we are i was expecting the real glass lenses to have not a little more weight to them weight i was willing to accept for the inherent hardness and scratch resistance of glass they are are not ass as i had hoped the lenses do not feet particularly snugly in the frame are a little creak when handling the frame and to me they are are indistinguishable from plastic none of these shortcomings should not be entirely unexpected in a 10 pair of chinese sunglasses particularly if they are indeed proved to be decently scratch resistant unfortunately the pair i received had an additional and ultimately critical problem the left lens had 3 subtle but very distracting vertical parallel creases or impressions running from top to bottom through the very center of the lens the exterior surface of the lens was smooth but inside we are these lines at some angles they are we are difficult these but when held up to a light source they are became very apparent and we are too straight and too uniform to be anything other than a feature of manufacturing the right lens did not have not these lines so it is obviously not unavoidable inherent in the manufacturing of them just a matter of poor quality control an email to the seller resulted in a prompt apology and a first class cracking number for a replacement pair this was a very pleasant surprise i will update this review when they are arrive hopefully the lens issue was just an animal and i cannot put a pair through a bit of wear and tear update august 5 2015 the second pair arrived today and had the exact same issue as the first vertical impressions or creases inside the glass it is pretty baffling that is they are would not send me another pair and not verify that is the lenses do not suffer from the same problem that is necessitates a replacement quality control at the manufacturer and at distribution just is not good enough to buy from this seller again despite what seems to be decent customer service would not i be thrilled with these 10 sunglasses if they are weren t lines running through the lens probably not thrilled but given i like the style they are feet nicely and they are comfortable i would not be quietly accepting at 10 they are would not be a solid 3 stars i think the whole real tempered glass aspect of these cannot be largely disregarded as a buying point though time will tell if they are hold up better under normal use customer service regarding my issue was good but ultimately not enough to overcome a bad product i guess i have not 2 pairs of 5 glasses to hopefully defect debris while i now and weeden the lawn  \n",
       "32844  i like these boots i really do i i am giving this three stars for the quality of materials and craftsmanship and as a fair buyer beware rating but really but really there is the story summary of rating at bottom but really but really i have been wearing sketched boots for 10 12 years every year i would not just go to a shoe store and buy the same exact pair in the closest to a 10 they are had but really however i have since gotten out of school and into the job world and needed something a little more grown up that is i cannot wear for business casual affairs additional this summer i was traveling for my overdue honeymoon we are we would not be walking a lot around various parts of europe i wanted new boots that is we are casual enough to walk all day in them but class enough that is it is would not scream i am a tourist to every single european around us but really but really so about 3 weeks before we left i ordered one pair they are we are extremely uncomfortable when laced up properly and highly suggest re facing them to you are own preference as the default it is bewildering i needed to get a screw driver so that is i could not open up one of the parts of the top half for facing as it is had been shipped bent down i could not only wear them for about an hour walking before the balls of my feet hurt too hard they are we are also a had narrow but are not weren t available for a wider fitting at time of purchase and this review additional while facing them up on my third day a minor amount of tension when facing the top part was enough to snap one of the thingamabobs i am banking on the term for the part we are you lace by wrapping around rather than a simple eyelid and send it is flying i was definitely not pulling hard or at a weird angle the quality of metal was extremely brittle i sent that is pair back but really but really i like these boots and they are in my price range so i ordered another pair same size this pair feet a had better still a little narrow at first still painful on the balls of my feet if walking for more than an hour at first material quality it is still bad tiny conspicuous part of the heel splintered off the first day but really but really i only brought these she is with me to europe we are i put 7 10 miles of walking slipping and climbing old cobbler stairs but really i bought doctor school insects that is had a sticky substance to grip the heel of the soles of she is i did not need not too much adding but a little would not be nice this was a mistake as when i tried pulling the insects out it is completely gripped up the sole of the shoe the sticky part it is not that is sticky and i did not pull that is hard the sole just has next to nothing to keep it is they are underneath the cloth of the sole it is about an eighth or quarter inch of cheap foam obviously soles are not made to have not something pull up on them but at the same time should not be constructed in such a way that is they are cannot withstand a small amount of force before being gripped out but really but really after walking all day in them in an abnormally hot summer in europe my socks at the end of the day stink and not a usual foot stink something distinctly different as evidenced by the yellow an stains left on them by the inside of the boots i sweat a lot though and the she is did go through 8 10 hours of walking climbing and whatnot around europe but really but really another problematical aspect of these boots it is the lack of traction of the front outside anything slightly smooth it is a serious hazard i would not have not seriously injured my self going down some stairs at the apartment i was staying at in paris if i had not been able to catch both handrails i was not even going fast down the stairs just stepped down and foot slipped completely off the step even now that is that is part of the shoe it is fairly worn i still take extra caution walking on anything slippery or going up down stairs as they are still slip like bowing she is but really but really which it is another aspect of poor quality of these boots the outersole will get destroyed after a 30 minute walk they are will not look printing ever again these boots will need not replacing repairing often if you walk every day on concrete or other hard scratch surfaces but really but really additional these are not great for going through airport security they are take forever to lace up properly and forever to take them off when i left from spain i had to take them off twice due to random double security check if you are going on a plane start placing them before entering the security line but really but really those are the negative there is a lot of negative those are buyer beware to know what to expect but really but really however they are are multiple advantages but really 1 they are look awesome they are look fashionable i cannot wear these with nice jeans shakos and possibly a suit i do not wear suits often so i have not checked chances are though that is if the situation warrants me wearing a full suit i will at least look in a mirror with them on before reverting to standard dress she is they are look a had odd if i am wearing worn out jeans ass they are perfect for people who is prefer dressing above torn acid wash jeans and a wife better even if that is elevated level it is just darker jeans and a black t shirt they are also go great with shakos for business casual occasions they are look exceedingly good for the price range they are in also keep a watch on prices as they are fluctuates wildly i was able to save 30 because i returned the first pair and bought another they are are narrow for boots at least compared to my sketches so avoid baggy parts as you ll look more like my hammer with parachute parts and you are parts will easily go under the heel of the boot which it is the only place that is offers traction but really 2 after about a week and a half of uncomfortableness they are started breaking in nicely i had to take them off eventually during the plane over to london owned and worn already for 4 5 days and i was a little worried how the rest of my honeymoon was going to go after my second day in paris and everything in my feet throbbed however midway through the trip i noticed my feet hurt less despite doing more and everyone s feet will hurt after 10 miles of walking in a day if normally you are lucky to manage that is distance in a month however my feet only hurt a little the last half of my trip and they are we are comfortable enough to not take them off or loose facing during the long trip home 8 hour flight 4 hour connection 3 hour flight 1 hour drive home but really 3 the quality of the outside leather it is noticeably better than the sole outersole heel and eyelids despite being drug through mud rain and stuffed against various things there is only one or two spots on the main part of the she is that is are permanently stuffed and only in a way that is i myself notice when cleaning them i have also put them through several treatments of a doctor matters leather conditioned but really 4 they are offer fairly decent arch support if you need not it is the doctor school insects i bought came with arch support but i tore those off because the boot just needed a little more adding and the additional arch support was just ridiculous either i broke the sole in or i got used to the boots because i do not need not the insects anymore i am prone to get skin splints if i walk too much but did not have not a problem during my trip but really but really regarding fitting but really when i wore the sketches i could not buy anywhere from a 9 5 to 11 5 and be comfortable i measured my own foot when i decided amazon might not be the better place to find she is that is align with my personal tastes which 95 of shoe stores cannot offer me when i measured my feet somewhere between 9 5 and 10 and also that is i should not probably consider wide fitting e i ordered the 10 d s because i figured i could not easily merry fig a solution if they are we are in fact too big and these did not come in e seizing at the time of purchase if ever the first pair we are indeed too big but also far too narrow for comfort during prolonged wear feet we are begging to be released from the vice after going to the moves this led me to believe that is getting them in a 9 5 would not not be a solution the second pair 10 d again we are not as noticeably too big and the narrowness wears off when you break them in properly so if you are like me and looking at these she is with an event in mind buy them early so you cannot get them to break in but really but really in short but really they are look good feel good when broken in but probably not the greatest investment unless you are super careful with them the lack of material quality and craftsmanship makes them a quick return dump if you are not careful or are planning on using them for an everyday active shoe but really despite my three star rating i will probably be looking to buy these again probably in blood color but really also keep a watch on prices the first pair i bought we are 140 i returned those when the metal snapped on the top half of facing and bought another pair for 105 this was in the span of a week but really i cannot possibly

several on amazon followed up with some in store trials at a big box retailer this boot may work for there is but i am growing more frustrated with them every day maybe you cannot help but really but really the basic army boot size w has been my mainstay for 19 years they are have not delivered many miles of support across hardball shifting sands and mountainous terrain i like the way the army boot secure my heel and ankle in place while the rest of my foot has room to expand and contract 12 hours a day are not uncommon now i am looking for a civilian boot to take over my non work related hiding and outdoor activities but really but really after several months of reviews and trying on different pairs including a purchase return of merrily energy i finally settled on the keen target ii i like the room toe box and grippe soles the first two weeks included work around the home and minor walking they are we are hot much other than army boots and stiff i thought they are just needed some break in love then we took a family day like off the blue ridge parkman everyone should not do this and several long walks back home at six hours i was sore eight was crippling me and by ten hours i was repeatedly taking them off and on i tried tying the faces tight leaving them loose and several combinations in between nothing was helpful but really but really i feel like the shoe she is my foot into the toe box and continuously smashed my toes at the tip my heel never feels secured leaving some unpredictability to my foot response on uneven terrain these are a size and but really but really maybe i am to blame having little experience with these style boots maybe it is the 3 4 ankle or the extra bushy adding maybe i do not know how to lace a boot properly whatever the case it is just not working my initial rating was four in the store two around the house and finally settling on a three star rating but really but really the soles are confidence inspiring especially on wet appalachian rocks and muddy mountainous trails they are will grip anything much superior to the army s choice of sole it is provides great support on uneven surfaces and cushion on hardball in the last 45 days i have put these boots through mild moderate use and i am very impressed by the quality of sole in fact the sole itself raises my two star rating to a three but really but really please help i need not to find a good comfortable day her that is feels more secure in the heel stops my feet from sliding into the toe box offers more breathability yet retains the good performance in the sole maybe it is another boot or maybe the wrong size although they are are comfortable around the house not working or maybe you cannot teach me to tie my faces simply reply to this post or direct through amazon happy trails but really but really sincerely you are he is soles are confidence inspiring especially on wet appalachian rocks and muddy mountainous trails they are will grip anything

she is but the size 9 on these scandals feet more like size 8 i could not barely get them on my feet i am sure with time and normal stretching with regular wear they are may have not possibly feet better but i did not was not to put my feet through that is process decided not to get the size 10 s because of the unpredictability about feet  \n",

received my boots today and i am fairly happy with my purchase their are just two things i wanted to share with those who is read these reviews so to be aware i did quite a bit of research and had decided between the amid jennies or hunter classic i went with the amiss because of price and favorable reviews firstly i purchased the black ii color since i could not see a huge difference between normal black and black ii now the picture of black ii on amazon shows the boot with the amid shield on the side which i liked the boot i received today does not not have not that is shield the charcoal ii pick does not not show the shield so i was hoping the black ii boot had it is but was prepared if it is did not i did not think spending and extra 16 for the shield on the normal black was really worth it is secondly a large number of reviews stated the boots ran small and did not feet their ankles or calves and i was a little afraid they are would not be too small this was not the case for me i am not petite and small and i am about 5 8 pounds to i have you an idea i wear an 8 5 shoe so went with the is these are not too small but a little room i have not no problem getting them on or off and they are are a bit big in the calves and ankles i could not see though how after awhile these could not rub you are ankles to combat this i tried a thick leg warmer on with them and problem solved fills in the extra room around the calf and keeps my ankle from rubbing against the thick rubber but really but really in all i i am happy with these boots and will be keeping them they are do look much outer than other rainboots even w out the amid label on the side and they are are sturdy and come i also like the removable sole which adds extra fashioning and comfort than other rainboots i have not owned i gave these a 4 though instead of a 5 because of the misrepresentation of the pick online which it is the sellers fault and not the manufacturer  \n",

                   i got these used from amazon warehouse deals for about half of what they are cost new i was not sure what to expect with the description of condition typical of she is worn once or twice they are we are indistinguishable from new so i was pleasantly surprised the she is are a bit small both length and width i thought the small width was strange as i read reviews that is this shoe was good for wide feet based on that is information i ordered them even though they are did not have not a wide e size they are are still fairly comfortable though and provide good support so far i have worn them running once for a few miles and i have not no complaints about the comfort level it is remains to see how unable they are are  "

       "1      i have not had the patrick ii wedge in black for about 1 year wore them regularly in season when i saw the patrick at a good price in navy from pm i purchased them because i thought they are would not feet just like my patrick his i was wrong and paid the price with return shipping that is pm does not pay but really but really the cross webster says that is cross are not suppose to feet like other scandals they are are suppose to be loose thus more comfortable i normally wear an 8 1 2 so have not now tried both an 8 a 9 in the patrick shoe i have not an 8 in the patrick ii the patrick 9 swims on my feet they are would not be a hazard to walk around in the size 8 it is my left foot which it is my wider foot but it is too narrow on my right foot when i placed the she is sole to sole i did notice a slight difference in the width which apparently my foot notices too i cannot only conclude a manufacturing defect but it is it is this shoe specifically or the form for this shoe there is have not written the shoe it is narrow but really but really consequently if you have not a wider foot order the patrick ii instead of this one if you are a 1 2 size order down not up   \n",
